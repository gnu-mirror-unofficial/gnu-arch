<p><strong><u>WARNING:</u></strong> This feature isn't present in the first release of tla 
but will be in the near future.
</p><p>In earlier chapters, we developed an extended example out of the
<code>hello-world</code>
 project.
</p><p>Alice and Bob, the primary programmers on the project, started one
archive and created some revisions there.
</p><p>Candice, a user of the project, created her own archive, started a
branch of the <code>hello-world</code>
 project, and began maintaining her own
local modifications.
</p><p>In this chapter, we'll begin to consider a situation that is more
typical of free software projects in the real world.   Here, we'll
consider Alice and Bob to be the maintainers of a public project, and
Candice as a major remote contributor to the project.  We'll identify
the new revision control needs that arise from that arrangement, and
look at some <code>arch</code>
 commands that help to satisfy those needs.

<h3 align=center>Promoting an Elementary Branch to a Development Branch</h3>










<p>So far, if you've been following the examples, Candice has an
elementary branch.  She made a branch from the mainline, made some
local changes, and has kept her branch up-to-date with Alice and Bob's
mainline.
</p><p>We're supposing, at this point, that Alice and Bob want to merge
Candice's changes into the mainline.
</p><p>Well, that merging work has already been done.  Candice's latest
revision is exactly the tree that Alice and Bob want.   They can 
incorporate that merge into their mainline very simply, by committing
Candice's latest revision to their own mainline:
</p><pre>

        % tla get -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                    hello-world--candice--0.1 \
                    hw-C
        [...]


        % cd hw-C

        % tla set-tree-version -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                    hello-world--mainline--0.1

        % tla make-log
        ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

        [... edit log file (consider `tla log-for-merge') ... ]

        % cat ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example
        Summary: merge from Candice's Branch
        Keywords: 

        Patches applied:

          * candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-2
             merge from mainline sources

          * candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-1

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Read Carefully Note:</u></strong>  Note carefully the <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

trick
</em>
 we just used.
Candice's latest revision was exactly what Alice and Bob wanted --
they combined <code>get</code>
 with <code>set-tree-version</code>
 to turn Candice's tree
into one they could easily commit to their own mainline.
</p>











<a name="Simple_Development_Branches"></a>



<h3 align=center>Simple Development Branches</h3>










<p>Let's consider what happens as development proceeds on both branches.
For this purpose, we'll introduce something new: a way of diagraming
branches and the merges between them.
</p><p>After the examples so far, we have this situation:
</p><pre>

      mainline-0.1                    candice-0.1
      ------------                    -----------
        base-0             -----------> base-0 (a tag)
        patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
        patch-2             ----------> patch-2
        patch-3  ----------'  --------'
        patch-4  &lt;-----------'


</pre>
<p>which tells us that the <code>candice</code>
 branch is a tag 
of <code>patch-1</code>
 from the mainline;  that at <code>patch-2</code>
 of the <code>candice</code>

branch, there was a merge of everything up to <code>patch-3</code>
 of the
<code>mainline</code>
; and finally that <code>patch-4</code>
 of the mainline merges
in everything up to <code>patch-2</code>
 from the <code>candice</code>
 branch.
</p><p>Whenever we have a such a diagram in which none of the merge lines
cross, that is a <em>
<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

simple development branch
</em>
.
</p><p>The significance of a simple development branch is that it's a model
for how two development efforts can work asynchronously on one
project.  Within each effort -- on each branch -- programmer's use the
&quot;update/commit&quot; style of cooperation (see <a href="update-commit.html#The_update/commit_Style_of_Cooperation">The update/commit Style of Cooperation</a>).   However, changes on one branch have no
effect on the other until the two branches are merged.
</p>











<a name="Introducing_The_Development_Branch_Merging_Problem"></a>



<h3 align=center>Introducing The Development Branch Merging Problem</h3>










<p>Let's suppose that more work happens on both the <code>mainline</code>
 and
<code>candice</code>
 branches, leaving us with:
</p><pre>

      mainline-0.1                    candice-0.1
      ------------                    -----------
        base-0             -----------> base-0 (a tag)
        patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
        patch-2             ----------> patch-2
        patch-3  ----------'  --------' patch-3
        patch-4  &lt;-----------'          patch-4
        patch-5
        patch-6


        % tla revisions --summary -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                          hello-world--candice--0.1
        base-0
            tag of 
            lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1
        patch-1
            Punctuated the output correctly
        patch-2
            merge from mainline sources
        patch-3
            added a period to output string
        patch-4
            capitalized the output string



        % tla revisions --summary -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                          hello-world--mainline--0.1
        base-0
            initial import
        patch-1
            Fix bugs in the &quot;hello world&quot; string
        patch-2
            commented return from main
        patch-3
            added copywrong statements
        patch-4
            merge from Candice's Branch
        patch-5
            fixed the copyrwrong for hw.c
        patch-6
            fixed the copyrwrong for main.c





</pre>
<p>Let's consider a scenario in which our goal is to merge the new work
on the <code>mainline</code>
 branch into the <code>candice</code>
 branch.  In other words,
we want to wind up with:
</p><pre>

      mainline-0.1                    candice-0.1
      ------------                    -----------
        base-0             -----------> base-0 (a tag)
        patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
        patch-2             ----------> patch-2
      patch-3  ----------'  --------' patch-3
      patch-4  &lt;-----------'          patch-4
        patch-5               --------> patch-5
        patch-6  ------------'


</pre>
<p>How can we perform that merge?  Let's start with the latest pre-merge
candice revision (<code>patch-4</code>
):
</p><pre>

        % tla get -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                       hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-4 \
                       hw-C-4
        [....]

        % cd hw-C-4


</pre>
<p>Here are two techniques that don't work:
</p>
<a name="replay_Does_Not_Solve_the_Development_Branch_Merge_Problem"></a>



<h4 align=center>replay Does Not Solve the Development Branch Merge Problem</h4>










<p><code>replay</code>
 will try to apply all &quot;missing&quot; changes from the <code>mainline</code>

into the <code>candice</code>
 tree.   The list of changeset it will apply is
given by:
</p><pre>

        % tla whats-missing --summary \
                              -A candice@candice.net--2003-example \
                              hello-world--mainline--0.1
        patch-4
            merge from Candice's Branch
        patch-5
            fixed the copyrwrong for hw.c
        patch-6
            fixed the copyrwrong for main.c


</pre>
<p>Problematic in that list is <code>patch-4</code>
.   It's a merge that includes
all of the changes from the <code>candice</code>
 branch up to its <code>patch-2</code>

level.   Yet those changes are already present in the <code>patch-4</code>

revision of the <code>candice</code>
 branch -- so <code>replay</code>
 will be applying them
redundantly (cause patch conflicts).
</p><p><strong><u>Note of Warning:</u></strong> The <code>replay</code>
 command will not prevent you from running
further replays even though the source tree is not in a consistant state. 
TLA in its current incarnation does not merge reject files. This leaves
open the possibility that patch rejects will be lost if a second <code>replay</code>

is performed before the rejects from the first replay are resolved. (Some day
TLA may be able to merge multiple rejects into a combined reject.)
</p><p><strong><u>Advanced User Note:</u></strong>  The <code>replay</code>
 command has options that would
allows us to skip the <code>patch-4</code>
 revision from the mainline.   That
sort of<em> solves the problem, but it has some drawbacks.  First, it
means that `patch-4' will continue to appear in the `whats-missing'
output of the `candice' branch.   Second, there is nothing that
guarantees us that the `patch-4' changeset contains </em>only* merges from
the <code>candice</code>
 branch.   If Alice and Bob made other changes in
<code>patch-4</code>
, and we skip that changeset, those other changes will be
lost.
</p>











<a name="update_Does_Not_Solve_the_Development_Branch_Merge_Problem"></a>



<h4 align=center>update Does Not Solve the Development Branch Merge Problem</h4>










<p>Suppose we try to <code>update</code>
 from the <code>mainline</code>
 branch.  Recall that
<code>update</code>
 will compute a changeset from the youngest <code>mainline</code>

ancestor of the project tree to the tree itself, then apply that
changeset to the latest <code>mainline</code>
 revision.
</p><p>We have a notation for this.  A changeset from <code>X</code>
 to <code>Y</code>
 is written:
</p><pre>
        delta(X, Y)

</pre>
<p>In this case, <code>update</code>
 will start by computing a changeset from the
<code>mainline</code>
 <code>patch-3</code>
 revision to our project tree:
</p><pre>
        delta(mainline--0.1--patch-3, hw-C-4) 

</pre>
<p>The tree that results for applying a changeset from <code>X</code>
 to <code>Y</code>
 to a
tree <code>Z</code>
 is written:
</p><pre>
        delta(X, Y) [ Z ]

</pre>
<p>In other words, the result of <code>update</code>
 in our example can be described
as:
</p><pre>
        delta(mainline--0.1--patch-3, hw-C-4) [mainline--0.1--patch-6]

</pre>
<p>Here's the problem, though.   The <code>patch-3</code>
 revision of <code>mainline</code>
 was
not previously merged with the <code>candice</code>
 branch.   Thus, the changeset
</p><pre>
        delta(mainline--0.1--patch-3, hw-C-4)

</pre>
<p>will include, among other changes, the changes from <code>patch-1</code>
 and
<code>patch-2</code>
 of the candice branch.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the tree we'll be applying that changeset to,
<code>mainline--0.1--patch-6</code>
, has already been merged with
<code>base-0...patch-2</code>
 of the <code>candice</code>
 branch.
</p><p>As with <code>replay</code>
, <code>update</code>
 will cause merge conflicts by making
redundant changes.
</p>






















<a name="Solving_One_Instance_of_the_Development_Branch_Merging_Problem"></a>



<h3 align=center>Solving One Instance of the Development Branch Merging Problem</h3>










<p>Using just our <code>delta</code>
 notation, let's look at solving this merge
problem cleanly.
</p><p>One possibility is that we want to give highest priority to the
<code>mainline</code>
 branch, merging in changes from <code>candice</code>
 and then lowest
priority to merging in any local changes that are only in the project
tree.  A solution that accomplishes that cleanly, without spurious 
conflicts from redundant changes is:
</p><pre>

   tmp = delta(X, Y)[Z]
     where X = candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--base-0
           Y = candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-2
           Z = lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-4
   

   answer = delta(L,M)[tmp]

     where L = lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-4
           M = /usr/lord/examples/wd/hw-AnB


</pre>
<p><strong><u>Usage Note:</u></strong> The concept of &quot;priority&quot; in merging has to do with
how (non-spurious) conflicts are handled.  By giving higher priority
to the <code>mainline</code>
, we ensure that conflicting changes from the other
two trees involved will be the ones that appear in <code>.rej</code>
 files.  That
can be important if, for example, we want to minimize changes made
relative to the <code>mainline</code>
 as conflicts are resolved.  (See
<a href="introducing-changesets.html#Inexact_Patching_--_How_Conflicts_are_Handled">Inexact Patching -- How Conflicts are Handled</a>.)
</p><p>A similar looking but different solution arises if we want to give
higher priority to the <code>candice</code>
 branch than the <code>mainline</code>
:
</p><pre>


   tmp = delta(X, Y)[Z]
     where X = candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-2
           Y = lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-6
           Z = lord@emf.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-4
   

   answer = delta(L,M)[tmp]

     where L = candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-4
           M = /usr/lord/examples/wd/hw-C-4



</pre>
<p>We could, in fact, implement those solutions in &quot;brute force&quot; way:
studying the merge histories of the two branches, coming up with those
solutions, checking out the necessary trees, using <code>mkpatch</code>
 to
compute changesets, and <code>dopatch</code>
 to apply them.   As we'll soon see,
however, <code>arch</code>
 has built-in support for this kind of merge.
</p>











<a name="star-merge_--_Solving_the_Development_Branch_Merging_Problem_in_General"></a>



<h3 align=center>star-merge -- Solving the Development Branch Merging Problem in General</h3>










<p>It's a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain the complete
solution to the development branch merging problem in general.  The
two solutions shown above illustrate two cases, but slightly different
solutions are sometimes necessary.
</p><p>What you should know is that when you have simple development
branches (see <a href="development-branches.html#Simple_Development_Branches">Simple Development Branches</a>), the command
<code>star-merge</code>
 knows how to merge between them without causing spurious
merge conflicts.
</p><p><code>star-merge</code>
 (with the <code>--in-place</code>
 option, as illustrated here)
expects two arguments: a fully qualified version or revision and 
the project tree that the merge should be performed upon, which
should start with './'
</p><p>For example, our two solutions from the previous section can be
achieved with either of these two solutions:
</p><pre>
        
        
        % tla get -A candice@candice.net--2003-candic \
                hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-4 \
                merge-temp
        % tla star-merge lord@emf.net--2003/hello-world-mainline--0.1 \
                merge-temp

                                        - or -
        % cd hw-C-4
        % tla undo 
        % tla star-merge lord@emf.net--2003/hello-world-mainline--0.1 .


</pre>
<p><strong><u>Usage Note:</u></strong>  Notice that the merge solutions we found earlier both 
involved the applications of two changesets.  In general, it's
possible that either or both of those can result in patch conflicts.
If conflicts occur after the first merge, <code>star-merge</code>
 stops and gives
you a chance to resolve the conflicts.   The <code>--finish</code>
 option to
<code>star-merge</code>
 can then be used to apply the second changeset (see
<code>tla star-merge --help</code>
).
