<h3 class="section">3.7 Inventory Ids for Source</h3>

<p><strong>Caution: Steep Learning Curve:</strong> As in the previous chapter, the
concepts and commands introduced here are likely to be unfamiliar to
you, even if you have used other revision control systems.   Once
you "get it", though, this will seem quite natural.  Best of all,
this is the last tricky step before we can start storing project trees
in an archive.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.1 Looks Like Source vs Really is Source</h4>

<p>In the previous chapter, we saw how to find out which files look like
source according to the naming conventions:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --names --source
             hw.c
             main.c
</pre>
   <p>In this chapter, there's a new distincition:  files which <em>look</em> like
source according to their names, vs. files which <em>really are</em> source.

   <p>When you save your project tree in an archive, arch will store the
files that <em>really are</em> source and ignore the rest.  We can ask which
files really are source by dropping the <code>--names</code> option to
<code>inventory</code>:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source
             [no output]
</pre>
   <p>It's a little more interesting if we include arch's own "system
files and directories" in the listing:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source --all --both
             {arch}
             {arch}/.arch-project-tree
             {arch}/=tagging-method
             {arch}/hello-world
             [....]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but the thing to note here is that <code>hw.c</code> and <code>main.c</code> aren't listed. 
Arch thinks they are source in name only.  The next section gives a
recipe to fix that, and the sections after that explain what's really
going on.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.2 The add Command</h4>

<p>We can tell arch that our files really are source, and should really
be archived with the project, using the <code>tla add</code> command:

<pre class="example">             % tla add hw.c
             % tla add main.c
</pre>
   <p>And now we get a better answer from:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source
             hw.c
             main.c
</pre>
   <p>A related command is <code>tla delete</code>:

<pre class="example">             % tla delete hw.c
</pre>
   <p>That doesn't delete the file <code>hw.c</code> itself:

<pre class="example">             % ls
             hw.c            hw.c.~1~        main.c          {arch}
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but it does remove it from the official list of source:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source
             main.c
</pre>
   <p>For the sake of the examples, we need to put <code>hw.c</code> back in the list:

<pre class="example">             % tla add hw.c
</pre>
   <pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source
             hw.c
             main.c
</pre>
   <p>Let's take a deeper look at what's going on when you <code>tla add</code> files:

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.3 Two Names for Every File</h4>

<p>In the <code>arch</code> world, every source file (and directory) in your project
tree has two names: a <a name="index-file-path-27"></a><dfn>file path</dfn> and a <a name="index-inventory-id-28"></a><dfn>inventory id</dfn>.

   <p>The <strong>file path</strong> of a file is the relative path to the file from the
root of the project tree.  It describes <em>where</em> within a source tree a
file is located.

   <p>The <strong>inventory id</strong> of a file is a (mostly) arbitrary string that is
unique to the file within the tree.   The inventory id remains
constant even if a file is renamed.   So while the file path says
where a file is located, the inventory id says which file it is
that's stored at that path.

   <p>The purpose of <code>tla add</code> is to assign an inventory id to a file.

   <p>In our example, we can examine the ids:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source --ids
             hw.c    x_very_long_string
             main.c  x_another_very_long_string
             ^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              |                |
              |           inventory ids
          file paths
</pre>
   <p>Ordinarily, when a file is moved, its file path changes, but its
inventory id should remain the same.  The <code>tla move</code> command
helps with this.   Suppose that we:

<pre class="example">             % mv hw.c hello.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">we should follow that with:

<pre class="example">             % tla move hw.c hello.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">after which:

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source --ids
             hello.c   x_very_long_string
             main.c    x_another_very_long_string
</pre>
   <p>Note that <code>hello.c</code> has the same inventory id that <code>hw.c</code> used to.

   <p>We'll come back to the topic of renames later so, for now, let's
put things back where they started:

<pre class="example">             % mv hello.c hw.c
             % tla move hello.c hw.c
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">3.7.4 Quick Aside &ndash; Adding Directories</h4>

<p>The <code>tla add</code> command applies to directories, too.   If we were to
create a new subdirectory in the tree, we should <code>tla add</code> it:

<pre class="example">             % mkdir docs
</pre>
   <pre class="example">             % tla inventory --names --source --both
             docs
             hw.c
             hello.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source --both
             hw.c
             hello.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">unless

<pre class="example">             % tla add docs
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then

<pre class="example">             % tla inventory --source --both
             docs
             hw.c
             hello.c
</pre>
   <p>But again, for the sake of our example, we don't need docs. 
We can just:

<pre class="example">             % rm -rf docs
</pre>
   <p>There isn't a need to <code>tla delete</code> a directory that we physically remove.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.5 How it Works &ndash; tla add</h4>

<p>What <code>tla add</code> does is fairly simple.   Note that when we added
<code>hw.c</code> and <code>main.c</code>, a new directory was created:

<pre class="example">             % ls -a
             .               .arch-ids       hw.c.~1~        {arch}
             ..              hw.c            main.c
</pre>
   <p>The <code>.arch-ids</code> directory is new:

<pre class="example">             % ls .arch-ids
             hw.c.id         main.c.id
</pre>
   <pre class="example">             % cat .arch-ids/hw.c.id
             very long string
</pre>
   <p>The <code>*.id</code> files is where the raw data that determines a file id are
stored.   The command <code>tla delete</code> removes those files.   The command
<code>tla move</code> renames them.

   <p>The id for a directory is stored slightly differently.  For example,
when we created a <code>docs</code> subdir and gave it an id with <code>tla add</code>, that
created a file <code>docs/.arch-ids/=id</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.6 Keeping Things Neat and Tidy</h4>

<p><a name="index-tree_002dlint-29"></a>

   <p>The command:

<pre class="example">             % tla tree-lint
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is useful for keeping things neat and tidy.

   <p><code>tree-lint</code> will tell you of any ids for which the corresponding file
does not exist.  It will tell you of any files that pass the naming
conventions, but for which no explicit id exists.

   <p>It will also warn you about files that don't fit the naming
conventions.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.7 Inventory Ids &ndash; There's More Than One Way to Do It</h4>

<p>In this chapter, you've learned about the basic commands <code>add</code>,
<code>move</code>, and <code>delete</code>.

   <p>The use of those tools for managing inventory ids was chosen as the
default behavior because, superficially at least, it resembles similar
commands in systems such as CVS which many users are already familiar
with.

   <p>There are other ways to manage inventory ids.   Sometimes the other
ways are more convenient.   A later chapter discusses these other
techniques (see: xref :<a name="index-g_t_0021_0021_0021-30"></a><dfn>!!!</dfn>).

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.8 Why is it Like This &ndash; The Purpose of Inventory Ids</h4>

<p>As you'll see in later chapters, <code>arch</code> is good at managing <em>changes</em>
made to source trees and the files they contain, and good at telling
you about the <em>history</em> of trees and files.

   <p>As an example, let's suppose that Alice and Bob are both working on
the <code>hello_world</code> project.  In her tree, Alice makes some changes to
<code>hw.c</code>.  In his tree, Bob renames <code>hw.c</code> to <code>hello.c</code>.

   <p>At some point it is necessary to "sync-up" Alice and Bob.  Bob
should wind up with the changes Alice has been making.   Alice should
wind up with the same file renaming that Bob has done.

   <p><code>arch</code> provides many mechanisms for that syncing up &ndash; it's one of the
most important things that <code>arch</code> can do &ndash; but nearly all of them
boil down to computing and applying <strong>changesets</strong>.

   <p>Alice can ask <code>arch</code> to create a changeset describing the work she's
done, and that changeset will describe the changes she made within
<code>hw.c</code>.  Bob can create a changeset and that changeset will describe
the file renaming he did.

   <p>If Alice applies Bob's changeset to her tree, her copy of <code>hw.c</code>
should be renamed <code>hello.c</code>.   But a trickier case is this:  What
happens if Bob applies Alice's changeset to his tree?

   <p>Alice changed a file named <code>./hw.c</code>, but in Bob's tree, those same
changes should be made to a file named <code>./hello.c</code>.  Fortunately, both
files have the same inventory id:

<pre class="example">
             file path               inventory id
             ---------               -------------

                      Alice's tree:
             ./hw.c                  x_very_long_string
                                                       \
                                                        - the same long string
                      Bob's tree:                      /
             ./hello.c               x_very_long_string

</pre>
   <p>In Alice's changeset, the changes Alice made are described as being
made to the file whose id is <code>x_very_long_string</code>.

   <p>Therefore, when applying that changeset to Bob's tree, <code>arch</code> knows to
apply the changes to the file with that same id;  it knows to apply
the changes to his <code>./hello.c</code>.

   <p>That example illustrates what inventory ids are for: they allow
<code>arch</code> to describe the changes made to a tree in terms of the logical
identity of files rather than their physical location.  There are many
more complicated examples of how inventory ids come into play, but
now you've seen at least the basic point.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.9 Why is it Like This &ndash; Why tla move Doesn't Move Files</h4>

<p>Why doesn't <code>tla delete</code> delete the file being removed from the source
category, or <code>tla move</code> rename it?

   <p>Those commands work as they do so that you can adjust the ids in a
tree even if some other tool which knows nothing about arch has
rearranged files.    For example, if you use a "directory editor" to
rename source files, <code>tla move</code> is available to catch-up to the
changes the directory editor made.

   <p>Sometimes, arch users request the addition of commands: <code>tla mv</code>, <code>tla
mkdir</code>, <code>tla rmdir</code>, and <code>tla rm</code> that would modify <em>both</em> ids and
the corresponding source files.  That's a great idea and it's not all
that hard: so, if you're looking for something to do, that's a good
idea for a real-world programming project on which to try-out and
learn arch.  Let us know on the <code>gnu-arch-users</code> mailing list if you
do this, so that we can consider merging your changes into the
distribution.

   <p><strong>Late Note:</strong> One user recently contributed a <code>tla mv</code> command which
aims to be an inventory-id-aware replacement for <code>mv(1)</code>.
