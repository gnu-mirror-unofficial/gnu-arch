<h3 class="section">5.5 Development Branches &ndash; The star-merge Style of Cooperation</h3>

<p>In earlier chapters, we developed an extended example out of the
<code>hello-world</code> project.

   <p>Alice and Bob, the primary programmers on the project, started one
archive and created some revisions there.

   <p>Candice, a user of the project, created her own archive, started a
branch of the <code>hello-world</code> project, and began maintaining her own
local modifications.

   <p>In this chapter, we'll begin to consider a situation that is more
typical of free software projects in the real world.   Here, we'll
consider Alice and Bob to be the maintainers of a public project, and
Candice as a major remote contributor to the project.  We'll identify
the new revision control needs that arise from that arrangement, and
look at some <code>arch</code> commands that help to satisfy those needs.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.1 Promoting an Elementary Branch to a Development Branch</h4>

<p>So far, if you've been following the examples, Candice has an
elementary branch.  She made a branch from the mainline, made some
local changes, and has kept her branch up-to-date with Alice and Bob's
mainline.

   <p>We're supposing, at this point, that Alice and Bob want to merge
Candice's changes into the mainline.

   <p>Well, that merging work has already been done.  Candice's latest
revision is exactly the tree that Alice and Bob want.   They can
incorporate that merge into their mainline very simply, by committing
Candice's latest revision to their own mainline:

<pre class="example">
             % tla get -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                         hello-world--candice--0.1 \
                         hw-C
             [...]

             % cd hw-C

             % tla set-tree-version -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                         hello-world--mainline--0.1

             % tla make-log
             ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

             [... edit log file (consider `tla log-for-merge') ... ]

             % cat ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example
             Summary: merge from Candice's Branch
             Keywords:

             Patches applied:

               * candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-2
                  merge from mainline sources

               * candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-1

                   lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1

             % tla commit
             [....]

</pre>
   <p><strong>Read Carefully Note:</strong>  Note carefully the <a name="index-trick-57"></a><dfn>trick</dfn> we just used. 
Candice's latest revision was exactly what Alice and Bob wanted &ndash;
they combined <code>get</code> with <code>set-tree-version</code> to turn Candice's tree
into one they could easily commit to their own mainline.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.2 Simple Development Branches</h4>

<p>Let's consider what happens as development proceeds on both branches. 
For this purpose, we'll introduce something new: a way of diagraming
branches and the merges between them.

   <p>After the examples so far, we have this situation:

<pre class="example">
           mainline--0.1                    candice--0.1
           -------------                    ------------
             base-0             -----------&gt; base-0 (a tag)
             patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
             patch-2             ----------&gt; patch-2
             patch-3  ----------'  --------'
             patch-4  &lt;-----------'

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells us that the <code>candice</code> branch is a tag
of <code>patch-1</code> from the mainline;  that at <code>patch-2</code> of the <code>candice</code>
branch, there was a merge of everything up to <code>patch-3</code> of the
<code>mainline</code>; and finally that <code>patch-4</code> of the mainline merges
in everything up to <code>patch-2</code> from the <code>candice</code> branch.

   <p>Whenever we have a such a diagram in which none of the merge lines
cross, that is a <a name="index-simple-development-branch-58"></a><dfn>simple development branch</dfn>.

   <p>The significance of a simple development branch is that it's a model
for how two development efforts can work asynchronously on one
project.  Within each effort &ndash; on each branch &ndash; programmer's use the
"update/commit" style of cooperation (see <a href="The-update_002fcommit-Style-of-Cooperation.html#The-update_002fcommit-Style-of-Cooperation">The update/commit Style of Cooperation</a>).   However, changes on one branch have no
effect on the other until the two branches are merged.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.3 Introducing The Development Branch Merging Problem</h4>

<p>Let's suppose that more work happens on both the <code>mainline</code> and
<code>candice</code> branches, leaving us with:

<pre class="example">
           mainline--0.1                    candice--0.1
           -------------                    ------------
             base-0             -----------&gt; base-0 (a tag)
             patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
             patch-2             ----------&gt; patch-2
             patch-3  ----------'  --------' patch-3
             patch-4  &lt;-----------'          patch-4
             patch-5
             patch-6

             % tla revisions --summary -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                               hello-world--candice--0.1
             base-0
                 tag of
                 lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1
             patch-1
                 Punctuated the output correctly
             patch-2
                 merge from mainline sources
             patch-3
                 added a period to output string
             patch-4
                 capitalized the output string

             % tla revisions --summary -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                               hello-world--mainline--0.1
             base-0
                 initial import
             patch-1
                 Fix bugs in the "hello world" string
             patch-2
                 commented return from main
             patch-3
                 added copywrong statements
             patch-4
                 merge from Candice's Branch
             patch-5
                 fixed the copyrwrong for hw.c
             patch-6
                 fixed the copyrwrong for main.c

</pre>
   <p>Let's consider a scenario in which our goal is to merge the new work
on the <code>mainline</code> branch into the <code>candice</code> branch.  In other words,
we want to wind up with:

<pre class="example">
           mainline--0.1                    candice--0.1
           -------------                    ------------
             base-0             -----------&gt; base-0 (a tag)
             patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
             patch-2             ----------&gt; patch-2
             patch-3  ----------'  --------' patch-3
             patch-4  &lt;-----------'          patch-4
             patch-5               --------&gt; patch-5
             patch-6  ------------'

</pre>
   <p>How can we perform that merge?  Let's start with the latest pre-merge
candice revision (<code>patch-4</code>):

<pre class="example">
             % tla get -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                            hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-4 \
                            hw-C-4
             [....]

             % cd hw-C-4

</pre>
   <p>Here are two techniques that <strong>don't</strong> work:

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.5.3.1 replay Does Not Solve the Development Branch Merge Problem</h5>

<p><code>replay</code> will try to apply all "missing" changes from the <code>mainline</code>
into the <code>candice</code> tree.   The list of changeset it will apply is
given by:

<pre class="example">
             % tla missing --summary \
                           -A candice@candice.net--2003-example \
                           hello-world--mainline--0.1
             patch-4
                 merge from Candice's Branch
             patch-5
                 fixed the copyrwrong for hw.c
             patch-6
                 fixed the copyrwrong for main.c

</pre>
   <p>Problematic in that list is <code>patch-4</code>.   It's a merge that includes
all of the changes from the <code>candice</code> branch up to its <code>patch-2</code>
level.   Yet those changes are already present in the <code>patch-4</code>
revision of the <code>candice</code> branch &ndash; so <code>replay</code> will be applying them
redundantly (cause patch conflicts).

   <p><strong>Note of Warning:</strong> The <code>replay</code> command will not prevent you from running
further replays even though the source tree is not in a consistant state. 
TLA in its current incarnation does not merge reject files. This leaves
open the possibility that patch rejects will be lost if a second <code>replay</code>
is performed before the rejects from the first replay are resolved. (Some day
TLA may be able to merge multiple rejects into a combined reject.)

   <p><strong>Advanced User Note:</strong>  The <code>replay</code> command has options that would
allows us to skip the <code>patch-4</code> revision from the mainline.   That
<em>sort of</em> solves the problem, but it has some drawbacks.  First, it
means that <code>patch-4</code> will continue to appear in the <code>missing</code> output
of the <code>candice</code> branch.  Second, there is nothing that guarantees us
that the <code>patch-4</code> changeset contains <em>only</em> merges from the <code>candice</code>
branch.  If Alice and Bob made other changes in <code>patch-4</code>, and we skip
that changeset, those other changes will be lost.

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.5.3.2 update Does Not Solve the Development Branch Merge Problem</h5>

<p>Suppose we try to <code>update</code> from the <code>mainline</code> branch.  Recall that
<code>update</code> will compute a changeset from the youngest <code>mainline</code>
ancestor of the project tree to the tree itself, then apply that
changeset to the latest <code>mainline</code> revision.

   <p>We have a notation for this.  A changeset from <code>X</code> to <code>Y</code> is written:

<pre class="example">             delta(X, Y)
</pre>
   <p>In this case, <code>update</code> will start by computing a changeset from the
<code>mainline</code> <code>patch-3</code> revision to our project tree:

<pre class="example">             delta(mainline--0.1--patch-3, hw-C-4)
</pre>
   <p>The tree that results for applying a changeset from <code>X</code> to <code>Y</code> to a
tree <code>Z</code> is written:

<pre class="example">             delta(X, Y) [ Z ]
</pre>
   <p>In other words, the result of <code>update</code> in our example can be described
as:

<pre class="example">             delta(mainline--0.1--patch-3, hw-C-4) [mainline--0.1--patch-6]
</pre>
   <p>Here's the problem, though.   The <code>patch-3</code> revision of <code>mainline</code> was
not previously merged with the <code>candice</code> branch.   Thus, the changeset

<pre class="example">             delta(mainline--0.1--patch-3, hw-C-4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will include, among other changes, the changes from <code>patch-1</code> and
<code>patch-2</code> of the candice branch.

   <p>Unfortunately, the tree we'll be applying that changeset to,
<code>mainline--0.1--patch-6</code>, has already been merged with
<code>base-0...patch-2</code> of the <code>candice</code> branch.

   <p>As with <code>replay</code>, <code>update</code> will cause merge conflicts by making
zredundant changes.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.4 Solving One Instance of the Development Branch Merging Problem</h4>

<p>Using just our <code>delta</code> notation and merge diagrams, let's look at
solving this merge problem cleanly.

   <p>Remember that we currently have:

<pre class="example">           mainline--0.1                    candice--0.1
           -------------                    ------------
             base-0             -----------&gt; base-0 (a tag)
             patch-1  ---------'             patch-1
             patch-2             ----------&gt; patch-2
             patch-3  ----------'  --------' patch-3
             patch-4  &lt;-----------'          patch-4
             patch-5
             patch-6
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and our goal is to create a new merge, for patch-5 of Candice's
branch:

<pre class="example">                                   --------&gt; patch-5
             patch-6  ------------'
</pre>
   <p>We might decide to start with a <code>mainline</code> branch and merge in missing
<code>candice</code> changes, or start with a <code>candice</code> tree and merge in missing
<code>mainline</code> changes.  Let's assume the latter (merging into a <code>candice</code>
tree).

   <p>In this case, <code>mainline-0.1</code> revision <code>patch-6</code> is "up to date" with
<code>candice-0.1</code> revision <code>patch-2</code>.   We want too apply all changes
since then to the latest <code>candice</code> revision:

<pre class="example">             with:
                     ancestor := candice--0.1--patch-2
                     merge_in := mainline--0.1--patch-6
                     target   := canidice--0.1--patch-4
</pre>
   <pre class="example">             answer := delta(ancestor, merge_in)[target]
</pre>
   <p>The arrows in the merge diagram are critical to figuring out the right
answer.  For example, suppose that the arrow from Candice's <code>patch-2</code>
to the <code>mainline</code> revision <code>patch-4</code> wasn't there.   Then the answer
would be:

<pre class="example">             with:
                     ancestor := mainline--0.1--patch-3
                     merge_in := mainline--0.1--patch-6
                     target   := canidice--0.1--patch-4
</pre>
   <pre class="example">             answer := delta(ancestor, merge_in)[target]
</pre>
   <p>Tracing out the arrows for a given merge is a tedious process. 
It's automated by the <code>star-merge</code> command:

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.5 star-merge &ndash; Solving the Development Branch Merging Problem in General</h4>

<p>It's a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain the complete
solution to the development branch merging problem in general.  The
two solutions shown above illustrate two cases, but slightly different
solutions are sometimes necessary.

   <p>What you should know is that when you have simple development
branches (see <strong>Simple Development Branches</strong> in <a href="Development-Branches-_002d_002d-The-star_002dmerge-Style-of-Cooperation.html#Development-Branches-_002d_002d-The-star_002dmerge-Style-of-Cooperation">Development Branches &ndash; The star-merge Style of Cooperation</a>), the command
<code>star-merge</code> knows how to merge between them without causing spurious
merge conflicts.

   <p>In ordinary use, you invoke <code>star-merge</code> in the tree you want to merge
info, providing as an argument the tree you want to merge from:

<pre class="example">
             % tla get -A candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                     hello-world--candice--0.1--patch-4 \
                     merge-temp
