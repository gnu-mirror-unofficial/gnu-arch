<p>In this chapter, we'll begin to explore the concept of <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

branching
</em>
,
which you may be familiar with from other revision control systems.
</p><p>If you are already familiar with the concept, you should be aware that
branching in <code>arch</code>
 almost certainly goes far beyond what you are
accustomed to.
</p><p>Regardless of whether or not you are familiar with the concept, fear
not -- we'll be starting slow:
</p>
<a name="A_Branching_Scenario_--_The_Need_for_Private_Changes"></a>



<h3 align=center>A Branching Scenario -- The Need for Private Changes</h3>










<p>Let's suppose for the moment that the <code>hello-world</code>
 project is making
its sources available as a public, read-only mirror (see
<a href="shared-and-public-archives.html#Shared_and_Public_Archives">Shared and Public Archives</a>).
</p><p>Early on, you (someone not involved in the <code>hello-world</code>
 project)
decides that you'll want to use their program, but that you'll need to
make some local changes.
</p><p>As a sort of toy example, let's suppose that you've decided that in
your environment, saying <em>
<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

hello world
</em>
 is unacceptable -- you really
require the more correctly punctuated <em>
<a name="index-pt:2"></a>

hello, world
</em>
.
</p><p>Now, here's the problem:  sure, you can download their sources and
make that change.  But meanwhile, the project is going to keep
working.  They're going to keep making changes.   So, you'll be faced
with a perpetual task of repeatedly downloading their latest sources
and copying your changes to their latest version.
</p><p><code>arch</code>
 can help automate that task, and this chapter explains how.
</p>











<a name="Making_a_Branch_from_a_Remote_Project_in_a_Local_Archive"></a>



<h3 align=center>Making a Branch from a Remote Project in a Local Archive</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:3"></a>

</p><p>In the examples that follow, you'll be changing roles.  Instead of
&quot;playing&quot; Alice or Bob, the programmers on the <code>hello-world</code>

project, you'll be playing Candice: a third party.
</p><p>Let's start by giving Candice her own archive to use, and making that
the default archive:
</p><pre>

        % tla make-archive candice@candice.net--2003-candice \
                             ~/{archives}/2003-candice

        % tla my-default-archive candice@candice.net--2003-candice
        default archive set (candice@candice.net--2003-candice)


</pre>
<p>(You can review what those commands do by reading <a href="new-archive.html#Creating_a_New_Archive">Creating a New Archive</a>.)
</p><p>Candice needs to create a <code>hello-world</code>
 project in her own archive.
She can use:
</p><pre>

        % tla archive-setup  hello-world--candice--0.1


</pre>
<p>She doesn't <em>have</em> to use the same project name that Alice and Bob are
using and, in fact, in this case she chose a different branch name.
(To review those commands, see <a href="new-project.html#Starting_a_New_Project">Starting a New Project</a>.)
</p><p>When Alice and Bob created their archive, they used <code>import</code>
 to create
the first revision.  Since we're creating a <em>branch</em>, we'll use a
different command.
</p><p>For the sake of example, let's suppose Candice is going to start from
the <code>patch-1</code>
 revision of Alice and Bob's archive:
</p><pre>

    % tla tag \
        lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1 \
        hello-world--candice--0.1
    [....]


</pre>
<p>There are a few things worth noting about that command.
</p><p>First, note that we used a <strong>fully qualified revision name</strong> to refer to
Alice and Bob's <code>patch-1</code>
 revision.  That's because that revision is
in some archive other than the current default archive.  (See
<a href="shared-and-public-archives.html#Working_with_Several_Archives_at_Once">Working with Several Archives at Once</a>.)
</p><p>Next, note that we specified the <code>patch-1</code>
 revision explicitly.  If we
had left of the <code>--patch-1</code>
 suffix, then the <code>tag</code>
 command would
assume we meant the <em>latest</em> revision in Alice and Bob's archive
(which happens to be <code>patch-3</code>
).
</p>











<a name="What_tag_Just_Did"></a>



<h3 align=center>What tag Just Did</h3>










<p>After using <code>tag</code>
, Candice now has a new revision in her archive:
</p><pre>

   % tla revisions --summary hello-world--candice--0.1
   base-0
       tag of lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1



</pre>
<p>She can retrieve that revision in the usual way:
</p><pre>

   % tla get hello-world--candice--0.1 hw-candice
   [...]

   % ls hw-candice
   hw.c         main.c          {arch}


</pre>
<p><strong><u>Nifty arch Feature:</u></strong> If you've followed along closely, you should
have noticed that Candice created a branch in her archive from an arch
revision stored in another archive entirely.  In our examples, both of
these archives happen to be on the local file system but that isn't
necessary: Candice could have formed her branch even if she was
accessing Alice and Bob's archive over the network.
</p><p><strong><u>Usage Caution:</u></strong>  Candice's job isn't quite done yet.   The next 
section explains another step she'll <em>probably</em> want to take.
</p>











<a name="Caching_a_tag_Revision"></a>



<h3 align=center>Caching a tag Revision</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:4"></a>

</p><p>Candice used <code>tag</code>
 to create a branch from Alice and Bob's archive.
When she uses <code>get</code>
 to check-out that revision, what happens?  Roughly
speaking, <code>arch</code>
 notices that the revision is a branch, then consults
Alice and Bob's archive to really get the source.
</p><p>The question then arises: what if Alice and Bob's archive &quot;goes
away&quot;?  As things stand, if that happens, Candice will no longer be
able to <code>get</code>
 from her branch.
</p><p>She can fix that though by caching in her archive all of the
information needed to build the revision:
</p><pre>

   % tla cacherev hello-world--candice--0.1--base-0
   [...]


</pre>
<p>and confirm that that worked with:
</p><pre>

   % tla cachedrevs hello-world--candice--0.1
   hello-world--candice--0.1--base-0


</pre>
<p>Thereafter, <code>arch</code>
 will no longer rely on Alice and Bob's archive to
retrieve Candice's <code>base-0</code>
 revision.
</p>











<a name="Exploring_the_New_Branch"></a>



<h3 align=center>Exploring the New Branch</h3>










<p>Earlier, Candice created her branch and used <code>get</code>
 to check it out.
Let's examine that tree:
</p><pre>

        % cd ~/wd/hw-candice

        % tla log-versions
        candice@candice.net--2003-candice/hello-world--candice--0.1
        lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1


</pre>
<p>Note that Candice's tree has patch logs both for Alice and Bob's
versions, and for her own branch:
</p><pre>

    % tla logs --summary \
            lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1
    base-0
        initial import
    patch-1
        Fix bugs in the &quot;hello world&quot; string


    % tla logs --summary hello-world--candice--0.1
    base-0
        tag of \
        lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1



</pre>
<p>There are not any later changes on Candice's branch:
</p><pre>
        % tla whats-missing hello-world--candice--0.1
        [no output]

</pre>
<p>but recall that Alice and Bob are already up to <code>patch-3</code>
:
</p><pre>
        % tla whats-missing -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                hello-world--mainline--0.1
        patch-2
        patch-3

</pre>












<a name="Making_a_Local_Change"></a>



<h3 align=center>Making a Local Change</h3>










<p>After the initial <code>tag</code>
, Candice can commit changes to her branch in
the usual way.
</p><p>Let's suppose that she has edited <code>hw.c</code>
 so that it now reads (in
part):
</p><pre>

        % cat hw.c
        [...]
        void
        hello_world (void)
        {
          (void)printf (&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
        }
        [...]


</pre>
<p>and that's she's prepared a log message:
</p><pre>

    % cat ++log.hello-world--candice--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-candice
    Summary: Punctuated the output correctly
    Keywords: 


    This program should say &quot;hello, world&quot; not &quot;hello world&quot;.


</pre>
<p>Now she can simply commit in the usual way, creating her own <code>patch-1</code>

revision:
</p><pre>

   % tla commit
   [....]

   % tla revisions --summary hello-world--candice--0.1
   base-0
       tag of \
       lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1
   patch-1
       Punctuated the output correctly


</pre>












<a name="Updating_from_a_Branched-from_Version"></a>



<h3 align=center>Updating from a Branched-from Version</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:5"></a>

<a name="index-pt:6"></a>

</p><p>Meanwhile, Alice and Bob have gone on to create their revisions
<code>patch-2</code>
 and <code>patch-3</code>
.   How can Candice add those changes to her
branch?
</p><p>Well, really, <code>arch</code>
 provides lots of techniques.  Using commands
we've already introduced, she could use either <code>update</code>
 or <code>replay</code>
.
In this example, we'll demonstrate using <code>replay</code>
.
</p><pre>

        % cd ~/wd/hw-candice

        % tla replay -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                hello-world--mainline--0.1
        [...]


</pre>
<p>Note that we used a <code>-A</code>
 argument to say which archive we are
replaying changes from, and a version name to say which changes we
want.  In this case, <code>replay</code>
 applied the changesets for <code>patch-2</code>
 and
<code>patch-3</code>
 to Candice's tree.
</p><p>This use of <code>replay</code>
 is a form of <em>
<a name="index-pt:7"></a>

merging
</em>
:  Candice's local changes
have been merged with Alice and Bob's <code>mainline</code>
 changes.
</p><p><strong><u>Learning Note:</u></strong>  If you're following along with the examples, you
should examine <code>hw.c</code>
 and notice that Candice's change to the <code>printf</code>

string and Alice's addition of a &quot;copywrong&quot; notice are both
included.
</p><p><strong><u>Learning Note:</u></strong> You should also check out a second copy of Candice's
<code>patch-1</code>
 revision and experiment with doing the same merge using
<code>update</code>
 instead of <code>replay</code>
.  You might have to look at <code>tla update
-help</code>
 to figure out exactly what options and arguments to provide.
</p><p>Note also that, so far, we've only made these changes to Candice's
project tree -- they haven't been checked into Candice's archive.  To
actually record the merge in her archive, she'll have to make a log
message and commit in the usual way (see <a href="checking-in-changes.html#Checking-in_Changes">Checking-in Changes</a>).
</p><p>There is, however, one more convenience to point out.  When Candice
writes her log message, she'll presumably want to note that the merge
took place and what it involves.  <code>arch</code>
 includes a command whose
output is ideal for inclusion in such a log message:
</p><pre>

  % cd ~/wd/hw-candice

  % tla log-for-merge
  Patches applied:

    * lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-3
       added copywrong statements

    * lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2
       commented return from main


</pre>












<a name="How_It_Works_--_tag_and_Elementary_Branches"></a>



<h3 align=center>How It Works -- tag and Elementary Branches</h3>










<p>What did <code>tag</code>
 do?  Let's look at Candice's archive:
</p><pre>

        % cd ~/{archives}
        % cd 2003-candice
        % cd hello-world
        % cd hello-world--candice
        % cd hello-world--candice--0.1

        % ls
        +version-lock   base-0          patch-1
        patch-2


</pre>
<p>Of particular interest is the <code>base-0</code>
 revision -- the one created by
<code>tag</code>
:
</p><pre>

        % cd base-0

        % ls
        CONTINUATION
        hello-world--candice--0.1--base-0.patches.tar.gz
        hello-world--candice--0.1--base-0.tar.gz
        log

        % cat CONTINUATION
        lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-1


</pre>
<p>The file <code>CONTINUATION</code>
 identifies this revision as a <code>tag</code>
 revision.
Its contents tell us what revision we branched from.
</p><p>The changeset for this revision (<code>....patches.tar.gz</code>
) was also
created by <code>tag</code>
.  If you explore that changeset (recall <code>get-patch</code>

and <code>patch-report</code>
) you'll see that all it does is add a log entry to
the tree's patch log.
</p><p>The source file (<code>...base-0.tar.gz</code>
) was created by
<code>archive-cache-revision</code>
.   It contains a complete copy of Candice's
<code>base-0</code>
 revision.  Since that file is there, <code>get</code>
 is not obligated
to look at Alice and Bob's archive to construct this revision.
