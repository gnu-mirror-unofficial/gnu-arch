<p><strong><u>Caution: Steep Learning Curve:</u></strong> As in the previous chapter, the
concepts and commands introduced here are likely to be unfamiliar to
you, even if you have used other revision control systems.   Once 
you &quot;get it&quot;, though, this will seem quite natural.  Best of all,
this is the last tricky step before we can start storing project trees
in an archive.

<h3 align=center>Looks Like Source vs Really is Source</h3>










<p>In the previous chapter, we saw how to find out which files look like
source according to the naming conventions:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --names --source
        hw.c
        main.c

</pre>
<p>In this chapter, there's a new distincition:  files which <em>look</em> like
source according to their names, vs. files which <em>really are</em> source.
</p><p>When you save your project tree in an archive, arch will store the
files that <em>really are</em> source and ignore the rest.  We can ask which
files really are source by dropping the <code>--names</code>
 option to
<code>inventory</code>
:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source
        [no output]

</pre>
<p>It's a little more interesting if we include arch's own &quot;system
files and directories&quot; in the listing:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source --all --both
        {arch}
        {arch}/.arch-project-tree
        {arch}/=tagging-method
        {arch}/hello-world
        [....]

</pre>
<p>but the thing to note here is that <code>hw.c</code>
 and <code>main.c</code>
 aren't listed.
Arch thinks they are source in name only.  The next section gives a
recipe to fix that, and the sections after that explain what's really
going on.
</p>











<a name="The_add_Command"></a>



<h3 align=center>The add Command</h3>










<p>We can tell arch that our files really are source, and should really
be archived with the project, using the <code>tla add</code>
 command:
</p><pre>
        % tla add hw.c
        % tla add main.c

</pre>
<p>And now we get a better answer from:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source
        hw.c
        main.c

</pre>
<p>A related command is <code>tla delete</code>
:
</p><pre>
        % tla delete hw.c

</pre>
<p>That doesn't delete the file <code>hw.c</code>
 itself:
</p><pre>
        % ls
        hw.c            hw.c.~1~        main.c          {arch}

</pre>
<p>but it does remove it from the official list of source:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source
        main.c

</pre>
<p>For the sake of the examples, we need to put <code>hw.c</code>
 back in the list:
</p><pre>
        % tla add hw.c

</pre>
<pre>
        % tla inventory --source
        hw.c
        main.c

</pre>
<p>Let's take a deeper look at what's going on when you <code>tla add</code>
 files:
</p>











<a name="Two_Names_for_Every_File"></a>



<h3 align=center>Two Names for Every File</h3>










<p>In the <code>arch</code>
 world, every source file (and directory) in your project
tree has two names: a <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

file path
</em>
 and a <em>
<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

inventory tag
</em>
.
</p><p>The <strong>file path</strong> of a file is the relative path to the file from the
root of the project tree.  It describes <em>where</em> within a source tree a
file is located.
</p><p>The <strong>inventory tag</strong> of a file is a (mostly) arbitrary string that is
unique to the file within the tree.   The inventory tag remains
constant even if a file is renamed.   So while the file path says
where a file is located, the inventory tag says which file it is
that's stored at that path.
</p><p>The purpose of <code>tla add</code>
 is to assign an inventory tag to a file.
</p><p>In our example, we can examine the tags:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source --tags
        hw.c    x_very_long_string
        main.c  x_another_very_long_string
        ^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         |                |
         |           inventory tags
     file paths

</pre>
<p>Ordinarily, when a file is moved, its file path changes, but its
inventory tag should remain the same.  The <code>tla move</code>
 command 
helps with this.   Suppose that we:
</p><pre>
        % mv hw.c hello.c

</pre>
<p>we should follow that with:
</p><pre>
        % tla move hw.c hello.c

</pre>
<p>after which:
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source --tags
        hello.c   x_very_long_string
        main.c    x_another_very_long_string

</pre>
<p>Note that <code>hello.c</code>
 has the same inventory tag that <code>hw.c</code>
 used to.
</p><p>We'll come back to the topic of renames later so, for now, let's 
put things back where they started:
</p><pre>
        % mv hello.c hw.c
        % tla move hello.c hw.c

</pre>












<a name="Quick_Aside_--_Adding_Directories"></a>



<h3 align=center>Quick Aside -- Adding Directories</h3>










<p>The <code>tla add</code>
 command applies to directories, too.   If we were to
create a new subdirectory in the tree, we should <code>tla add</code>
 it:
</p><pre>
        % mkdir docs

</pre>
<pre>
        % tla inventory --names --source --both
        docs
        hw.c
        hello.c

</pre>
<p>but
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source --both
        hw.c
        hello.c

</pre>
<p>unless
</p><pre>
        % tla add docs

</pre>
<p>and then
</p><pre>
        % tla inventory --source --both
        docs
        hw.c
        hello.c

</pre>
<p>But again, for the sake of our example, we don't need docs.
We can just:
</p><pre>
        % rm -rf docs

</pre>
<p>There isn't a need to <code>tla delete</code>
 a directory that we physically remove.
</p>











<a name="How_it_Works_--_tla_add"></a>



<h3 align=center>How it Works -- tla add</h3>










<p>What <code>tla add</code>
 does is fairly simple.   Note that when we added
<code>hw.c</code>
 and <code>main.c</code>
, a new directory was created:
</p><pre>
        % ls -a
        .               .arch-ids       hw.c.~1~        {arch}
        ..              hw.c            main.c

</pre>
<p>The <code>.arch-ids</code>
 directory is new:
</p><pre>
        % ls .arch-ids
        hw.c.id         main.c.id

</pre>
<pre>
        % cat .arch-ids/hw.c.id
        very long string

</pre>
<p>The <code>*.id</code>
 files is where the raw data that determines a file tag are
stored.   The command <code>tla delete</code>
 removes those files.   The command
<code>tla move</code>
 renames them.
</p><p>The tag for a directory is stored slightly differently.   For example,
when we created a <code>docs</code>
 subdir and tagged that with <code>tla add</code>
, that
created a file <code>docs/.arch-ids/=id</code>
.
</p>











<a name="Keeping_Things_Neat_and_Tidy"></a>



<h3 align=center>Keeping Things Neat and Tidy</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:2"></a>

</p><p>The command:
</p><pre>
        % tla tree-lint

</pre>
<p>is useful for keeping things neat and tidy.
</p><p><code>tree-lint</code>
 will tell you of any tags for which the corresponding file
does not exist.  It will tell you of any files that pass the naming
conventions, but for which no explicit tag exists.
</p><p>It will also warn you about files that don't fit the naming
conventions.
</p>











<a name="Inventory_Tags_--_There's_More_Than_One_Way_to_Do_It"></a>



<h3 align=center>Inventory Tags -- There's More Than One Way to Do It</h3>










<p>In this chapter, you've learned about the basic commands <code>add</code>
,
<code>move</code>
, and <code>delete</code>
.   
</p><p>The use of those tools for managing inventory tags was chosen as the
default behavior because, superficially at least, it resembles similar
commands in systems such as CVS which many users are already familiar
with.
</p><p>There are other ways to manage inventory tags.   Sometimes the other
ways are more convenient.   A later chapter discusses these other
techniques (see: xref :<em>
<a name="index-pt:3"></a>

!!!
</em>
).
</p>











<a name="Why_is_it_Like_This_--_The_Purpose_of_Inventory_Tags"></a>



<h3 align=center>Why is it Like This -- The Purpose of Inventory Tags</h3>










<p>As you'll see in later chapters, <code>arch</code>
 is good at managing <em>changes</em>
made to source trees and the files they contain, and good at telling
you about the <em>history</em> of trees and files.
</p><p>As an example, let's suppose that Alice and Bob are both working on
the <code>hello_world</code>
 project.  In her tree, Alice makes some changes to
<code>hw.c</code>
.  In his tree, Bob renames <code>hw.c</code>
 to <code>hello.c</code>
.
</p><p>At some point it is necessary to &quot;sync-up&quot; Alice and Bob.  Bob
should wind up with the changes Alice has been making.   Alice should
wind up with the same file renaming that Bob has done.
</p><p><code>arch</code>
 provides many mechanisms for that syncing up -- it's one of the
most important things that <code>arch</code>
 can do -- but nearly all of them
boil down to computing and applying <strong>changesets</strong>.
</p><p>Alice can ask <code>arch</code>
 to create a changeset describing the work she's
done, and that changeset will describe the changes she made within
<code>hw.c</code>
.  Bob can create a changeset and that changeset will describe
the file renaming he did.
</p><p>If Alice applies Bob's changeset to her tree, her copy of <code>hw.c</code>

should be renamed <code>hello.c</code>
.   But a trickier case is this:  What
happens if Bob applies Alice's changeset to his tree?
</p><p>Alice changed a file named <code>./hw.c</code>
, but in Bob's tree, those same
changes should be made to a file named <code>./hello.c</code>
.  Fortunately, both
files have the same inventory tag:
</p><pre>

        file path               inventory tag
        ---------               -------------

                 Alice's tree:
        ./hw.c                  x_very_long_string
                                                  \ 
                                                   - the same long string
                 Bob's tree:                      /
        ./hello.c               x_very_long_string


</pre>
<p>In Alice's changeset, the changes Alice made are described as being
made to the file whose tag is <code>x_very_long_string</code>
.
</p><p>Therefore, when applying that changeset to Bob's tree, <code>arch</code>
 knows to
apply the changes to the file with that same tag;  it knows to apply
the changes to his <code>./hello.c</code>
.
</p><p>That example illustrates what inventory tags are for: they allow
<code>arch</code>
 to describe the changes made to a tree in terms of the logical
identity of files rather than their physical location.  There are many
more complicated examples of how inventory tags come into play, but
now you've seen at least the basic point.
</p>











<a name="Why_is_it_Like_This_--_Why_tla_move_Doesn't_Move_Files"></a>



<h3 align=center>Why is it Like This -- Why tla move Doesn't Move Files</h3>










<p>Why doesn't <code>tla delete</code>
 delete the file being removed from the source
category, or <code>tla move</code>
 rename it?
</p><p>Those commands work as they do so that you can adjust the tags in a
tree even if some other tool which knows nothing about arch has
rearranged files.    For example, if you use a &quot;directory editor&quot; to
rename source files, <code>tla move</code>
 is available to catch-up to the
changes the directory editor made.
</p><p>Sometimes, arch users request the addition of commands: <code>tla mv</code>
, <code>tla
mkdir</code>
, <code>tla rmdir</code>
, and <code>tla rm</code>
 that would modify <em>both</em> tags and
the corresponding source files.  That's a great idea and it's not all
that hard: so, if you're looking for something to do, that's a good
idea for a real-world programming project on which to try-out and
learn arch.  Let us know on the <code>gnu-arch-users</code>
 mailing list if you
do this, so that we can consider merging your changes into the
distribution.
