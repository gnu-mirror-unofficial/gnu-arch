<h2 class="chapter">5 Collaborating With Other People</h2>

<p>GNU Arch is a <em>distributed</em> revision control system, meaning that
it does not require the use of a central &ldquo;repository&rdquo; for people to
collaborate.  However, it does allow for such a cooperation model and
the next subsection will detail how to do this.

   <p>The following subsections focus on distributed revision control&mdash;that
is, how to exchange data among branches located at different remote
sites in order to efficiently collaborate.  This is a salient feature
of GNU Arch and is extremely useful in development patterns that are
inherently distributed, as is common with Free Software.

   <p>From a practical viewpoint, one may also argue that the distributed
approach can supersede the centralized approach even in cases where
developers are tightly connected (e.g., within a company).  First it
removes the need to set up a single central repository which in effect
is a single point of failure.  Second, it does not require complex
access right management which is usually implied by the use of a
central repository.  Finally, it allows each developer to synchronize
its working branch(es) with other people's work when she/he sees fit.
