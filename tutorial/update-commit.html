<p>In earlier chapters, you learned how to add a project to an archive,
store the initial sources, store changes made to those sources, and
retrieve revisions from the archive.
</p><p>In the previous chapter, you learned how to make an archive network
accessible.
</p><p>This chapter will begin to explore how multiple programmers can share
an archive, with each of them making changes to a particular project.
</p><p>You should take note at the outset that there are really many subtle
variations on how programmers can share archives and otherwise
cooperate on a given project.   We're starting here with one of the
very <em>simplest</em> techniques.

<h3 align=center>Alice and Bob Hack main</h3>










<p>Let's suppose that Alice and Bob are both working on the <code>hello-world</code>

project and that they are sharing a single archive.  In the examples
that follow, we'll play both roles.
</p><p>For starters, each programmer will need their own project tree:
</p><pre>
        % cd ~/wd

        % [ ... remove any directories left from earlier examples ...]


        % tla get hello-world--mainline--0.1  hello-world-Alice
        [....]

        % tla get hello-world--mainline--0.1  hello-world-Bob
        [....]

</pre>
<p>Alice's task is to add some legal notices to each file.  When she's
done (but has not yet used <code>commit</code>
 to write her changes to the
archive), the files look this way:
</p><pre>
        % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Alice

        % head -3 main.c
        /* Copywrong 1998 howdycorp inc.  All rights reversed.*/

        extern void hello_world (void);

        % head hw.c
        /* Copywrong 1998 howdycorp inc.  All rights reversed. */

        #include &lt;stdio.h>

</pre>
<p>Bob, meanwhile, has added a much-needed comment to <code>main</code>
:
</p><pre>
        % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Bob

        % cat main.c
        extern void hello_world (void);

        int
        main (int argc, char * argv[])
        {
          hello_world ();

          /* Exit with status 0
           */
          return 0;
        }

        /* arch-tag: main module of the hello-world project
         */

</pre>
<p>Note that the two programmers now have modified versions of
<code>hello-world</code>
, but neither programmer has the other's changes.
</p>











<a name="Bob_commits_First"></a>



<h3 align=center>Bob commits First</h3>










<p>Let's suppose that Bob is the first to try to commit his changes.
Just to review, there are two steps.
</p><p>First, Bob prepares a log message:
</p><pre>
   % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Bob

   % tla make-log
   ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

   [Bob edits the log message.]

   % cat ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example
   Summary: commented return from main
   Keywords: 

   Added a comment explaining how the return from `main'
   relates to the exit status of the program.


</pre>
<p>Then he calls <code>commit</code>
:
</p><pre>
   % tla commit
   [...]

</pre>












<a name="Alice_Can_Not_commit_Yet"></a>



<h3 align=center>Alice Can Not commit Yet</h3>










<p>Now it's Alice's turn:
</p><pre>
   % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Alice

   % tla make-log
   ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

   [Alice edits the log message.]

   % cat ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example
   Summary: added copywrong statements
   Keywords: 

   Added copywrong statements to the source files so 
   that nobody can steal HowdyCorp's code.


</pre>
<p>And then tries to commit:
</p><pre>
   % tla commit
   cmtrev: tree is not up-to-date (missing latest revision is lord@emf.net--2003b--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2)

</pre>
<p>The problem here is that Bob's changes have already been stored in the
archive, but Alice's tree doesn't reflect those changes.
</p>











<a name="Studying_Why_Alice_Can_Not_commit"></a>



<h3 align=center>Studying Why Alice Can Not commit</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:0"></a>

<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

</p><p>The <code>commit</code>
 command told Alice that here tree is &quot;out of date&quot;. 
That means that changes have been committed to the archive that her
tree doesn't have yet.   
</p><p>She can examine the situation in a little more depth by asking
what her tree is missing:
</p><pre>
        % tla whats-missing
        patch-2

</pre>
<p>or for more detail:
</p><pre>
        % tla whats-missing --summary
        patch-2
            commented return from main

</pre>
<p>which you should recognize as the <code>Summary:</code>
 line from Bob's log
message.
</p><p>She can get even more detail with the (previously introduced)
<code>revisions</code>
 command (see <a href="importing-first.html#Storing_the_First_Revision_in_the_Archive">Storing the First Revision in the Archive</a>).
</p><p>She can view Bob's entire log message:
</p><pre>
    % tla cat-archive-log hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2
    Revision: hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2
    Archive: lord@emf.net--2003-example
    Creator: Tom (testing) Lord &lt;lord@emf.net>
    Date: Wed Jan 29 12:46:50 PST 2003
    Standard-date: 2003-01-29 20:46:50 GMT
    Summary: commented return from main
    Keywords: 
    New-files: {arch}/hello-world/[....]
    Modified-files: main.c
    New-patches: \
      lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2

    Added a comment explaining how the return from `main'
    relates to the exit status of the program.


</pre>
<p>By looking at the headers of that message, Alice can figure out, for
example, that Bob modified the file <code>main.c</code>
.
</p><p>In later chapters, we'll explore more commands that Alice can use to
study the changes that Bob made, but for now, let's turn to how Alice
can add those changes to her tree.
</p>











<a name="The_update_Command"></a>



<h3 align=center>The update Command</h3>










<p>Alice needs to combine her changes with Bob's before she can <code>commit</code>

her changes.   One easy way to do that is the <code>update</code>
 command:
</p><pre>
        % cd ~/wd

        % tla update --in-place hello-world-Alice
        [....]


</pre>
<p>Now she will find Bob's changes added to her tree:
</p><pre>
        % cd hello-world-Alice

        % cat main.c
        /* Copywrong 1998 howdycorp inc.  All rights reversed. */

        extern void hello_world (void);

        int
        main (int argc, char * argv[])
        {
          hello_world ();

          /* Exit with status 0
           */
          return 0;
        }

        /* arch-tag: main module of the hello-world project
         */

</pre>
<p>Since no further changes are missing:
</p><pre>
        % tla whats-missing
        [no output]

</pre>
<p><code>commit</code>
 is happy to proceed:
</p><pre>
        % tla commit
        [....]

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Learning Note:</u></strong> If you're following along with the examples, you
should still have a tree in <code>hello-world-Bob</code>
 that has Bob's changes,
but not Alice's.   Try various commands for that directory to explore
(<code>whats-missing</code>
, <code>update</code>
, <code>what-changed</code>
 and so forth).
</p>











<a name="How_it_Works_--_The_update_Command"></a>



<h3 align=center>How it Works -- The update Command</h3>










<p>A <em>full</em> explanation of how <code>update</code>
 works is a little beyond the
scope of this chapter.  You'll be able understand <code>update</code>
 in detail
after a few of the later chapters (on changesets and patch logs).
</p><p>For now, if you are familiar with <code>diff</code>
 and <code>patch</code>
, you can think of
it this way:
</p><p>When <code>update</code>
 is run in Alice's tree, it notices that the archive is
up to a <code>patch-2</code>
 revision, but that her tree was checked out as a
<code>get</code>
 of the <code>patch-1</code>
 revision.   <code>update</code>
 works in three steps:
</p><p>First, it uses a command called <code>mkpatch</code>
 (which is kind of a fancier
variation on <code>diff</code>
) to compute a changeset (a fancy patch set)
that describes the changes Alice made to her tree.
</p><p>Second, it checks out a copy of the <code>patch-2</code>
 revision and replaces 
Alice's tree with that revision.
</p><p>Third, <code>update</code>
 uses <code>dopatch</code>
 (a fancier <code>patch</code>
) to apply the 
changeset from the first step to the new tree.
</p><p>You may be wondering how patch conflicts are handled.  The examples
above were carefully crafted to avoid any conflicts.  Don't worry --
we'll get to that topic soon enough (see <a href="introducing-changesets.html#Inexact_Patching_--_How_Conflicts_are_Handled">Inexact Patching -- How Conflicts are Handled</a>).
