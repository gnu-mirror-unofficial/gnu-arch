<p>In the earlier chapters, you learned how to create your first archive,
start a project, check in the initial sources and subsequent changes,
and retrieve past revisions.
</p><p>In this chapter you'll learn how to make an archive available over a
network and begin to learn how multiple programmers can share a single
archive.

<a name="Registering_for_Network_Access_to_Archives"></a>



<h3 align=center>Registering for Network Access to Archives</h3>










<p>As you should recall, an archive has both a logical name, and a
physical location:
</p><pre>
        % tla archives
        lord@emf.net--2003-example
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          |     /usr/lord/{archives}/2003-example
          |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          |                     |
          |              archive location        
          |
        archive name

</pre>
<p>(See <a href="new-archive.html#Creating_a_New_Archive">Creating a New Archive</a>.)
</p><p>Some archives can be accessed over a network, currently via any
of the protocols:
</p><pre>
        FTP
        SFTP
        WebDAV
        plain HTTP

</pre>
<p>Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to create such archives.
</p><p>For now, you should know that to access such an archive, you register
it's name and physical location, using a URL for the physical
location.
</p><p>For example, to access an HTTP or WebDAV archive:
</p><pre>
    % tla register-archive lord@emf.net--2003b \
            http://regexps.srparish.net/{archives}/lord@emf.net--2003b

</pre>
<p>or an FTP archive:
</p><pre>
    % tla register-archive lord@regexps.com--2002 \
            ftp://ftp.regexps.com/{archives}/lord@regexps.com--2002

</pre>
<p>You can see that these commands have taken effect:
</p><pre>
    % tla archives
    lord@emf.net--2003b
            http://regexps.srparish.net/{archives}/lord@emf.net--2003b
    lord@emf.net--2003-example
            /usr/lord/examples/{archives}/2003-example
    lord@regexps.com--2002
            ftp://ftp.regexps.com/{archives}/lord@regexps.com--2002

</pre>

<h3 align=center>Working with Several Archives at Once</h3>










<p>After you've registered additional archives, how do you access them?
</p><p>One trivial way is to make the archive you are interested in your
default:
</p><pre>

        % tla my-default-archive lord@emf.net--2003

        % tla categories
        [...categories in the remote archive...]


</pre>
<p>It can, of course, be inconvenient to keep changing your default
archive.  So for now, let's restore it to the archive we've been
using in the examples:
</p><pre>
        % tla my-default-archive lord@emf.net--2003-example

</pre>
<p>There are two other ways to access a remote archive:
</p>
<a name="Selecting_an_Archive_with_-A"></a>



<h4 align=center>Selecting an Archive with -A</h4>










<p>Every command that operates on archives accepts a <code>-A</code>
 option which
can be used to override the default:
</p><pre>
        % tla my-default-archive
        lord@emf.net--2003-example

        % tla categories -A lord@emf.net--2003
        [... categories in lord@emf.net--2003 ...]

z/*end-insert

\Usage Note:/ A `-A' argument takes precedence over your default
archive but is overridden by fully qualified project names (see
below).


 * 
 * 
 */
/************************************************************************
 *(h2 &quot;Fully Qualified Project Names&quot;)
 * 

Commands that accept project names allow you to use &quot;fully qualified
project names&quot;.   A fully qualified name is formed by prefixing an
archive name, followed by a slash, to the project name:


insert*/
   category name:
   tla                     => lord@emf.net--2003/tla

   branch name:
   tla--devo               => lord@emf.net--2003/arch--tla

   version name:
   tla--devo--1.0          => lord@emf.net--2003/tla--devo--1.0

   revision name:
   tla--devo--1.0--patch-1 => lord@emf.net--2003/tla--devo--1.0--patch-1


</pre>
<p>As in this example:
</p><pre>
        % tla my-default-archive
        lord@emf.net--2003-example

        % tla branches lord@emf.net--2003/hello-world
        [... branches of hello-world in lord@emf.net--2003 ...]


</pre>
<p><strong><u>Usage Note:</u></strong> A fully qualified name takes precedence over both <code>-A</code>

arguments and your default archive.
</p>






















<a name="Read-only_Archives"></a>



<h3 align=center>Read-only Archives</h3>










<p>Operating system and server access controls can be used to limit some
or all users to <em>read-only</em> access.  For example, FTP is usually
configured in such a way that anonymous users can read, but not modify
the archive.
</p>











<a name="Creating_Local_Mirrors,_Remote_Mirrors,_and_Remote_Archives"></a>



<h3 align=center>Creating Local Mirrors, Remote Mirrors, and Remote Archives</h3>










<p>A <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

mirror
</em>
 is an archive whose contents are copied from another
archive.   You can not commit to a mirror in the ordinary way, you can
only update it's copy of it's source.
</p><p>There are two primary uses for mirror archives:  one is to make a
local copy of a remote mirror (so that it's contents can be accessed
without going over a network);   the other is to make a remote copy of
a local archive (so that others can access that copy).
</p>
<a name="Mirroring_a_Remote_Archive_Locally"></a>



<h4 align=center>Mirroring a Remote Archive Locally</h4>










<p>Let's suppose that, in order to have the fastest possible access to
it, or to be able to use it while disconnected, you want to mirror a
remote archive locally rather than accessing it over network.
</p><p>Supposing that you wanted to do this with <code>lord@emf.net--2003b</code>
, there
are three steps (suppose $remote_location is something like 
http://my.site.com//archives/lord@emf.net--2003b).
</p><p>First, register the remote archive under a pseudonum, formed by
appending <code>-SOURCE</code>
 to it's name:
</p><pre>
        % tla register-archive lord@emf.net--2003b-SOURCE $remote_location

</pre>
<p>Second, create your local mirror:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --mirror-from lord@emf.net--2003b-SOURCE $local_location

</pre>
<p>That command will, as a side effect, register <code>lord@emf.net--2003b</code>
 as
the name of your local mirror.
</p><p>Finally, copy data from the remote archive:
</p><pre>
        % tla archive-mirror lord@emf.net--2003b

</pre>
<p>Whenever the remote archive has been added to, you can incrementally
update your mirror by repeating the <code>tla archive-mirror</code>
 step.
</p><p>If you don't want to mirror the entire archive, you can optionally
limit the mirror to specific categories, branches, or versions. See
tla archive-mirror -H for more.
</p>











<a name="Mirroring_a_Local_Archive_Remotely"></a>



<h4 align=center>Mirroring a Local Archive Remotely</h4>










<p>Let's suppose that you have a local archive <code>mine@somewhere.com</code>
, and
you'd like to &quot;publish&quot; a mirror of that archive on the Internet
so that other people can read from it.
</p><p>Assuming that you already have <code>mine@somewhere.com</code>
 registered, you
can create the remote mirror with:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --mirror mine@somewhere.com $remote_location

</pre>
<p>Arch will write directly to $remote_location, so it must be a writeable
transport such as sftp, and not something such as standard http.
</p><p>You can initialize or incrementally update the contents of the remote
mirror with:
</p><pre>
        % tla archive-mirror mine@somewhere.com

</pre>
<p>One common situation for many people is that they are able to 
install static files as part of a web site, but they can't provide
WebDAV access to that web site.   Even under those conditions you can
still publish an arch archive, though there are two subtleties.
</p><p>First, when running make-archive, you need to provide an extra flag:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --listing --mirror mine@somewhere.com \
                        $remote_location

</pre>
<p>The <code>--listing</code>
 flag causes arch to keep <code>.listing</code>
 files up-to-date
in the mirror, and that, in turn, allows people to read from the
archive using arch over vanilla HTTP (sans WebDAV support).
</p><p>Second, it _is_ possible for the <code>.listing</code>
 files to fall out of date
(for example, if you kill an <code>archive-mirror</code>
 command at just the
right time_.   If you know or suspect that has occurred, you can repair
the archive in question by running archive-fixup as in this example:
</p><pre>
        % tla archive-fixup mine@somewhere.com-MIRROR

</pre>












<a name="Making_a_Remote_Repository"></a>



<h4 align=center>Making a Remote Repository</h4>










<p>Although mirroring is a common use of remote repositories, it is
possible to create remote repositories which are not mirrors, and then
to commit to those directly.   
</p><p>One can create a remote repository with a command such as:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive $archive_name $remote_location

</pre>
<p>or, to create a remote repository with .listing files:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --listing $archive_name $remote_location

</pre>























<a name="Mixing_Access_Modes"></a>



<h3 align=center>Mixing Access Modes</h3>










<p>There is nothing to prevent you from making a single archive available
via multiple access methods.   For example, you can register an FTP
accessible archive using a local-filesystem location on the machine
that contains the FTP directory, but ask other users to register it
with an <code>ftp:</code>
 URL.
