<p><code>arch</code>
 is a <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

Community Supported Free Software Project
</em>
 -- I rely on
the financial support of the community to be able to develop <code>arch</code>

and the other free software projects that I work on.
</p><p>If you are able to help out, even just a little, please do so.  I'm
able to accept contributions as <code>lord@emf.net</code>
 on Paypal.
Arrangements can be made to accept contributions larger than a few 10s
of dollars as a tax-deductible contribution to a non-profit
organization (contact me if you would like to do this.)
</p><p>Finally, if you represent a business or non-profit organization, I
offer a <em>
<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

Release Subscription Service
</em>
 -- a formally invoiced
mechanism, suitable for corporate purchasing practices, for
contributing and gaining recognition in my eyes as a true customer for
my development work.  (Again, please contact me if this is of interest
to you.)
