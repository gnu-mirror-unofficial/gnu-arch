<p>I, Tom Lord, the author of <code>arch</code>
, have been unemployed for a very
long time now, and my sole proprietorship revenues, while non-0, have
left me <em>far</em> below the poverty line.
</p><p>&quot;Boo-hoo&quot;, I know.  Things are tough all over.
</p><p>In the absence of any alternative, I funded much of the work to
develop <code>arch</code>
 by cashing in all my retirement savings, selling the
little bit of stock I owned, selling many possessions (I really miss
my guitars and CDs), and racking up some <em>enormous</em> credit card debts
(some soon to be written off as bad debt!).  Why did I do those
seemingly crazy things?  Partly out of necessity -- but partly also
because I BELIEVE IN <code>arch</code>
 THAT MUCH AND YOU SHOULD TOO.
</p><p>So here's the deal:
</p><p>1) I'm grateful to receive &quot;gifts&quot; (which I treat as business
income) sent to my PayPal account <code>lord@emf.net</code>
.
</p><p>2) I'm very interested in any jobs that might be available in the
S.F. Bay Area (especially Alameda, S.F., or work-at-home) for a really
excellent C/Scheme/sh/awk/unix programmer.  No, I've never hacked
linux device drivers, SQL, PHP, TCP/IP stacks, Java Beans, J2EE, or
Visual Studio.  Yes I do prefer opportunities to work on free
software.
</p><p>3) &quot;Practical Research&quot; is what I do best.  I have a lot of projects
in the fire, so to speak -- <code>arch</code>
 is just one.  If you have any good
ideas about how to fund them, send me email.
</p><p>4) <code>arch</code>
 can (with a <em>little</em> more development) save the industry
millions in licensing fees for proprietary revision control systems.
IBM, Red Hat, HP/C, United Linux members, Apple, potential business
partners with capital: I'm talking to you!  Send me email.
</p><p>5) In general: I NEED MONEY (desperately) -- so if you can help,
please get in touch.
