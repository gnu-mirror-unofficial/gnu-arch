<h3 class="section">5.1 The update/commit Style of Cooperation</h3>

<p>In earlier chapters, you learned how to add a project to an archive,
store the initial sources, store changes made to those sources, and
retrieve revisions from the archive.

   <p>This chapter will begin to explore how multiple programmers can share
an archive, with each of them making changes to a particular project.

   <p>You should take note at the outset that there are really many subtle
variations on how programmers can share archives and otherwise
cooperate on a given project.  We're starting here with one of the
very <em>simplest</em> techniques.  In this example, we will see how to
use a single, central archive shared among several developers.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Alice and Bob Hack main</h4>

<p>Let's suppose that Alice and Bob are both working on the <code>hello-world</code>
project and that they are sharing a single archive.  In the examples
that follow, we'll play both roles.

   <p>For starters, each programmer will need their own project tree:

<pre class="example">             % cd ~/wd

             % [ ... remove any directories left from earlier examples ...]

             % tla get hello-world--mainline--0.1  hello-world-Alice
             [....]

             % tla get hello-world--mainline--0.1  hello-world-Bob
             [....]
</pre>
   <p>Alice's task is to add some legal notices to each file.  When she's
done (but has not yet used <code>commit</code> to write her changes to the
archive), the files look this way:

<pre class="example">             % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Alice

             % head -3 main.c
             /* Copywrong 1998 howdycorp inc.  All rights reversed.*/

             extern void hello_world (void);

             % head hw.c
             /* Copywrong 1998 howdycorp inc.  All rights reversed. */

             #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Bob, meanwhile, has added a much-needed comment to <code>main</code>:

<pre class="example">             % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Bob

             % cat main.c
             extern void hello_world (void);

             int
             main (int argc, char * argv[])
             {
               hello_world ();

               /* Exit with status 0
                */
               return 0;
             }

</pre>
   <p>Note that the two programmers now have modified versions of
<code>hello-world</code>, but neither programmer has the other's changes.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 Bob commits First</h4>

<p>Let's suppose that Bob is the first to try to commit his changes. 
Just to review, there are two steps.

   <p>First, Bob prepares a log message:

<pre class="example">        % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Bob

        % tla make-log
        ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

        [Bob edits the log message.]

        % cat ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example
        Summary: commented return from main
        Keywords:

        Added a comment explaining how the return from `main'
        relates to the exit status of the program.

</pre>
   <p>Then he calls <code>commit</code>:

<pre class="example">        % tla commit
        [...]
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">5.1.3 Alice Can Not commit Yet</h4>

<p>Now it's Alice's turn:

<pre class="example">        % cd ~/wd/hello-world-Alice

        % tla make-log
        ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example

        [Alice edits the log message.]

        % cat ++log.hello-world--mainline--0.1--lord@emf.net--2003-example
        Summary: added copywrong statements
        Keywords:

        Added copywrong statements to the source files so
        that nobody can steal HowdyCorp's code.

</pre>
   <p>And then tries to commit:

<pre class="example">        % tla commit
        commit: tree is not up-to-date
          (missing latest revision is
            lord@emf.net--2003b--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2)
</pre>
   <p>The problem here is that Bob's changes have already been stored in the
archive, but Alice's tree doesn't reflect those changes.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 Studying Why Alice Can Not commit</h4>

<p><a name="index-missing-45"></a>
<a name="index-cat_002darchive_002dlog-46"></a>

   <p>The <code>commit</code> command told Alice that her tree is "out of date". 
That means that changes have been committed to the archive that her
tree doesn't have yet.

   <p>She can examine the situation in a little more depth by asking
what her tree is missing:

<pre class="example">             % tla missing
             patch-2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or for more detail:

<pre class="example">             % tla missing --summary
             patch-2
                 commented return from main
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which you should recognize as the <code>Summary:</code> line from Bob's log
message.

   <p>She can get even more detail with the (previously introduced)
<code>revisions</code> command (see <strong>Storing the First Revision in the Archive</strong> in <a href="Importing-the-First-Revision.html#Importing-the-First-Revision">Importing the First Revision</a>).

   <p>She can view Bob's entire log message:

<pre class="example">         % tla cat-archive-log hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2
         Revision: hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2
         Archive: lord@emf.net--2003-example
         Creator: Tom (testing) Lord &lt;lord@emf.net&gt;
         Date: Wed Jan 29 12:46:50 PST 2003
         Standard-date: 2003-01-29 20:46:50 GMT
         Summary: commented return from main
         Keywords:
         New-files: {arch}/hello-world/[....]
         Modified-files: main.c
         New-patches: \
           lord@emf.net--2003-example/hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-2

         Added a comment explaining how the return from `main'
         relates to the exit status of the program.

</pre>
   <p>By looking at the headers of that message, Alice can figure out, for
example, that Bob modified the file <code>main.c</code>.

   <p>In later chapters, we'll explore more commands that Alice can use to
study the changes that Bob made, but for now, let's turn to how Alice
can add those changes to her tree.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.5 The update Command</h4>

<p>Alice needs to combine her changes with Bob's before she can <code>commit</code>
her changes.   One easy way to do that is the <code>update</code> command:

<pre class="example">             % cd ~/wd

             % tla update --in-place hello-world-Alice
             [....]

</pre>
   <p>Now she will find Bob's changes added to her tree:

<pre class="example">             % cd hello-world-Alice

             % cat main.c
             /* Copywrong 1998 howdycorp inc.  All rights reversed. */

             extern void hello_world (void);

             int
             main (int argc, char * argv[])
             {
               hello_world ();

               /* Exit with status 0
                */
               return 0;
             }

             /* arch-tag: main module of the hello-world project
              */
</pre>
   <p>Since no further changes are missing:

<pre class="example">             % tla missing
             [no output]
</pre>
   <p><code>commit</code> is happy to proceed:

<pre class="example">             % tla commit
             [....]
</pre>
   <p><strong>Learning Note:</strong> If you're following along with the examples, you should
still have a tree in <code>hello-world-Bob</code> that has Bob's changes, but not
Alice's.  Try various commands for that directory to explore (<code>missing</code>,
<code>update</code>, <code>changes</code> and so forth).

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.6 How it Works &ndash; The update Command</h4>

<p>A <em>full</em> explanation of how <code>update</code> works is a little beyond the
scope of this chapter.  You'll be able understand <code>update</code> in detail
after a few of the later chapters (on changesets and patch logs).

   <p>For now, if you are familiar with <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code>, you can think of
it this way:

   <p>When <code>update</code> is run in Alice's tree, it notices that the archive is
up to a <code>patch-2</code> revision, but that her tree was checked out as a
<code>get</code> of the <code>patch-1</code> revision.   <code>update</code> works in three steps:

   <p>First, it uses a command called <code>mkpatch</code> (which is kind of a fancier
variation on <code>diff</code>) to compute a changeset (a fancy patch set)
that describes the changes Alice made to her tree.

   <p>Second, it checks out a copy of the <code>patch-2</code> revision and replaces
Alice's tree with that revision.

   <p>Third, <code>update</code> uses <code>dopatch</code> (a fancier <code>patch</code>) to apply the
changeset from the first step to the new tree.

   <p>You may be wondering how patch conflicts are handled.  The examples
above were carefully crafted to avoid any conflicts.  Don't worry &ndash;
we'll get to that topic soon enough (see <a href="Inexact-Patching-_002d_002d-How-Conflicts-are-Handled.html#Inexact-Patching-_002d_002d-How-Conflicts-are-Handled">Inexact Patching &ndash; How Conflicts are Handled</a>).
