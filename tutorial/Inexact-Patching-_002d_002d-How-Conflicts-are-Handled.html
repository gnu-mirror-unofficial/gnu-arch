<h4 class="subsection">A.2.3 Inexact Patching &ndash; How Conflicts are Handled</h4>

<p><a name="index-inexact-patching-101"></a>

   <p>What if a tree patched by <code>dopatch</code> is not exactly the same as the
original tree seen by <code>mkpatch</code>?

   <p>Below is a brief description of what to expect.  Complete
documentation of the <code>dopatch</code> process is included with the source
code.

   <p><code>dopatch</code> takes an inventory of the tree being patched.  It uses
inventory ids to decide which files and directories expected by the
changeset are present or missing from the tree, and to figure out
where each file and directory is located in the tree.

   <p><strong>Simple Patches</strong> If the changeset contains an ordinary patch or
metadata patch for a link, directory or file, and that file is present
in the tree, <code>dopatch</code> applies the patch in the ordinary way.  If the
patch applies cleanly, the modified file, link, or directory is left
in place.

   <p>If a simple patch fails to apply cleanly, <code>dopatch</code> will always leave
behind a <code>.orig</code> file (the file originally in the tree being patched,
without any changes) and a <code>.rej</code> file (the part of the patch that
could not be applied).

   <p>If the patch was a context diff, <code>dopatch</code> will also leave behind the
file itself &ndash; partially patched.

   <p>If an (unsuccessful) patch was for a binary file, no partially-patched
file will be left.  Instead, there will be:

<pre class="example">             .orig   -- the file originally in the tree being patched,
                        without modifications.

             .rej    -- a complete copy of the file from the modified tree,
                        with permissions copied from `.orig'.

             .patch-orig -- a complete copy of the file from the original
                            tree seen by `mkpatch', with permissions
                            retained from that original

                             -or-

                            the symbolic link from the original tree seen
                            by `mkpatch' with permissions as in the original
                            tree.

</pre>
   <p>If an (unsuccessful) patch was for a symbolic link, no partially
patched file will be left.  Instead there will be:

<pre class="example">             .orig   -- the unmodified file from the original tree

             .rej    -- a symbolic link with the target intended by the
                        patch and permissions copied from .orig

             .patch-orig -- a complete copy of the file from the original
                            tree seen by `mkpatch', with permissions
                            retained from that original

                             -or-

                            the symbolic link from the original tree seen
                            by `mkpatch' with permissions as in the original
                            tree.

</pre>
   <p><strong>Patches for Missing Files</strong>

   <p>All patches for missing files and directories are stored in a
subdirectory of the root of the tree being patched called

<pre class="example">             ==missing-file-patches-PATCH-DATE
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <code>PATCH</code> is the basename of the changeset directory and <code>DATE</code> a
time-stamp.

   <p><strong>Directory Rearrangements and New Directories</strong>

   <p>Directories are added, deleted, and rearranged much as you would
expect, even if you don't know it's what you'd expect.

   <p>Suppose that when <code>mkpatch</code> was called the <code>ORIGINAL</code> tree had:

<pre class="example">             Directory or file:              Id:

             a/x.c                           id_1
             a/bar.c                         id_2

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but the <code>MODIFIED</code> tree had:

<pre class="example">             a/x.c                           id_1
             a/y.c                           id_2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with changes to both files.  The patch will want to rename the file
with id <code>id_2</code> to <code>y.c</code>, and change the contents of the files with
ids <code>id_1</code> and <code>id_2</code>.

   <p>Suppose, for example, that you have a tree with:

<pre class="example">             a/foo.c                         id_1
             a/zip.c                         id_2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the you apply the patch to that tree.  After the patch, you'll be
left with:

<pre class="example">             a/foo.c                         id_1
             a/y.c (was zip.c)               id_2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with patches made to the contents of both files.

   <p>Here's a sample of some subtleties and ways of handling conflicts:

   <p>Suppose that the original tree seen by mkpatch has:

<pre class="example">             Directory or file:              Id:

             ./a                             id_a
             ./a/b                           id_b
             ./a/b/c                         id_c

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and that the modified directory has:

<pre class="example">             ./a                             id_a
             ./a/c                           id_c
             ./a/c/b                         id_b
</pre>
   <p>Finally, suppose that the tree has:

<pre class="example">             ./x                             id_a
             ./x/b                           id_b
             ./x/c                           id_new_directory
             ./x/c/b                         id_different_file_named_b
             ./x/c/q                         id_c
</pre>
   <p>When patch gets done with the tree, it will have:

<pre class="example">             ./x                             id_a
                     Since the patch doesn't do anything
                     to change the directory with id_a.

             ./x/c.orig                      id_new_directory
             ./x/c.rej                       id_c
                     Since the patch wants to make the
                     directory with id_c a subdirectory named "c"
                     of the directory with id_a, but the tree
                     already had a different directory there,
                     with the id id_new_directory.

             ./x/c.rej/b                     id_b
                     Since the patch wants to rename the directory
                     with id_b to be a subdirectory named "b"
                     of the directory with id_c.

             ./x/c.orig/b                    id_different_file_named_b
                     Since the patch made new changes to this file,
                     it stayed with its parent directory.
