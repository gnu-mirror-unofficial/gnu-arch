<p>In order to use <code>arch</code>
, there are some software tools that you must
already have available.  These don't necessarily need to be on your
<code>PATH</code>
 -- <code>arch</code>
 can use a separate <code>PATH</code>
 if you need it to.
</p><p><strong><u>GNU Make</u></strong> You will need <code>GNU Make</code>
 in order to build <code>arch</code>
.
</p><p><strong><u>GNU Tar</u></strong> You must have <code>GNU tar</code>
.  More specifically, you must have
a version of tar that has options:
</p><pre>
        -zcf F          to create a gzip-compressed tar file called
                        F, where F may be `-', meaning to write
                        the tar file to the standard-output stream

</pre>
<pre>
        -zxf F          to extract files from a gzip-compressed tar
                        file called F, where F may be `-', meaning
                        to read the tar file from the standard-input
                        stream.  

</pre>
<pre>
        -T -            This option reads a list of files from
                        standard input.  Only those files are 
                        read or written to the archive -- others
                        are ignored.

</pre>
<pre>
        -m              When extracting files, don't restore
                        modification times.

</pre>
<p><strong><u>GNU diff and GNU patch</u></strong> After much deliberation, I've decided to go
ahead and rely on the <strong>GNU</strong> versions of <code>diff</code>
 and <code>patch</code>
.
Specifically, you need a version of <code>diff</code>
 that can generate &quot;unified
format&quot; output (option <code>-u</code>
) and a version of <code>patch</code>
 that
understands that format and that understand <code>--posix</code>
.  (It would be
trivial to use &quot;context diffs&quot; and, thus, standard <code>diff</code>
 and
<code>patch</code>
, however, unified diffs are much easier to read, and I'm
hoping that picking specific implementations of these critical
sub-components will help contribute to the long-term stability of
<code>arch</code>
.)
</p><p><strong><u>Standard Posix Shell Tools</u></strong> The package framework (i.e., the
configure and build process) assumes that some standard Posix shell
tools are available on your system:
</p><pre>
        awk
        cat
        chmod
        date
        echo
        find
        fold
        grep
        head
        ls
        mkdir
        printf
        pwd
        rm
        sed
        sh
        tee
        test
        touch
        tsort
        wc
        xargs

</pre>
<p><strong><u>The null Device</u></strong> Your system must have <code>/dev/null</code>
.  Output directed
to <code>/dev/null</code>
 should simply disappear from the universe, in the usual
way.
