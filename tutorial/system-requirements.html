<p>In order to use <code>arch</code>
, there are some software tools that you must
already have available.  
</p>
<a name="Tools_Used_to_Build_arch"></a>



<h3 align=center>Tools Used to Build arch</h3>










<p><strong><u>GNU Make</u></strong> You will need <code>GNU Make</code>
 in order to build <code>arch</code>
.
</p><p><strong><u>Standard Posix Shell Tools</u></strong> The package framework (i.e., the
configure and build process) assumes that some standard Posix shell
tools are available on your system:
</p><pre>
        awk     find    mkdir   sh      wc
        cat     fold    printf  tee     xargs
        chmod   grep    pwd     test
        date    head    rm      touch
        echo    ls      sed     tsort

</pre>
<p><em>Note:</em>  On some systems, the program installed as <code>/bin/sh</code>
 is
<em>not</em> a Posix shell (it may be a variant of <code>csh</code>
 or a very buggy
implementation of Posix <code>sh</code>
).   On such systems, you should use a 
different shell to run <code>configure</code>
, such as:
</p><pre>
  % /usr/local/bin/bash ../configure --config-shell /usr/local/bin/bash

</pre>
<p><strong><u>The null Device</u></strong> Your system must have <code>/dev/null</code>
.  Information
directed to <code>/dev/null</code>
 should simply disappear from the universe.  As
a special &quot;Green Software&quot; measure, we have made provisions that
will enable your computers to convert that discarded information into
<em>heat</em>, which you may use to supplement conventional heating
systems.
</p>











<a name="Tools_Used_Internally_by_arch"></a>



<h3 align=center>Tools Used Internally by arch</h3>










<p>The remaining tools are used internally by arch itself.  They don't
necessarily need to be on your <code>PATH</code>
 -- when you build <code>arch</code>
 from
source, run the configure script:
</p><pre>
       % ./configure --help

</pre>
<p>and
</p><pre>
        % ./configure --help-options

</pre>
<p>for information about how to point <code>arch</code>
 to the correct versions.
</p><p><strong><u>GNU Tar</u></strong> You must have <code>GNU tar</code>
.  <code>arch</code>
 invokes <code>tar</code>
 internally to
pack and unpack files that it stores in archives.   It is important
that all versions of <code>arch</code>
 use a compatible version of <code>tar</code>
, for
which purpose <code>GNU tar</code>
 was chosen.
</p><p><strong><u>GNU diff and GNU patch</u></strong> After much deliberation, I've decided to go
ahead and rely on the <strong>GNU</strong> versions of <code>diff</code>
 and <code>patch</code>
.
Specifically, you need a version of <code>diff</code>
 that can generate &quot;unified
format&quot; output (option <code>-u</code>
) and a version of <code>patch</code>
 that
understands that format and that understands <code>--posix</code>
.  (It would be
trivial to use &quot;context diffs&quot; and, thus, standard <code>diff</code>
 and
<code>patch</code>
, however, unified diffs are much easier to read, and I'm
hoping that picking specific implementations of these critical
sub-components will help contribute to the long-term stability of
<code>arch</code>
.)
