<p><a name="index-pt:0"></a>

</p><p>An arch changeset is a directory containing a number of files and
subdirectories.  Each is described below.
</p><p><strong><u>Files:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        orig-dirs-index
        mod-dirs-index
        orig-files-index
        mod-files-index

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Format:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        &lt;file path>&lt;tab>&lt;tag>

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Sorting:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        sort -k 2

</pre>
<p>These contain indexes for all files and directories added, removed, or
modified between the two trees.
</p><p><strong><u>Files:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        original-only-dir-metadata
        modified-only-dir-metadata

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Format:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        &lt;metadata>&lt;tab>&lt;name>

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Sorting:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        sort -t '&lt;tab>' -k 2

</pre>
<p>The field <code>&lt;metadata></code>
 contains literal output from the program
<code>file-metadata</code>
 given the options <code>--permissions</code>
.  Some example
output is:
</p><pre>
        --permissions 777

</pre>
<p>That output is also suitable for use as options and option arguments
to the program <code>set-file-metadata</code>
.   Future releases <code>arch</code>
 might add
additional flags (beside just <code>permissions</code>
).
</p><p>The list records the file permissions for all directories present in
only one of the two trees.
</p><p><strong><u>Directories:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        removed-files-archive
        new-files-archive

</pre>
<p>Each of these directories contains complete copies of all files that
occur in only the original tree (<code>removed-files-archive</code>
) or modified
tree (<code>new-files-archive</code>
).  Each saved file is archived at the same
relative location it had in its source tree, with permissions (at
least) preserved.
</p><p><strong><u>Directory:</u></strong>
</p><pre>
        patches

</pre>
<p>This directory contains a tree whose directory structure is a subset
of the directory structure of the modified tree.  It contains
modification data for directories and files common to both trees.
</p><p>For a file stored in the modified tree at the path <code>new_name</code>
, the
<code>patches</code>
 directory may contain:
</p><pre>

        new_name.link-orig

                The original file is a symbolic link.
                `new_name.link-orig' is a text file containing the
                target of that link plus a final newline.

                This file is only present if link target has changed,
                or if the link was replaced by a regular file.


        new_name.link-mod

                The modified file is a symbolic link and this file
                is a text file containing the target for the link plus
                a final newline.

                This file is only present if the link target has
                changed, or if the link replaces a regular file.


        new_name.original

                This is a complete copy of the file from the original
                tree, preserving (at least) permissions.

                This file is only present if the file was replaced by
                a symbolic link, or if the file contents can not be
                handled by `diff(1)'.


        new_name.modified

                This is a complete copy of the file from the modified
                tree, preserving (at least) permissions.

                This file is only present if the file replaces a
                symbolic link, or if the file contents can not be
                handled by `diff(1)'.

        new_name.patch

                This is a standard context diff between the original
                file and modified file.  One popular version of diff
                (`GNU diff') generates non-standard context diffs by
                omitting one copy of lines of context that are
                identical between the original and modified file, so
                for now, `.patch' files may have the same bug.
                Fortunately, the only popular version of `patch'
                (``GNU patch'') is tolerant of receiving such input.

                

        new_name.meta-orig
        new_name.meta-mod

                File metadata (currently only permissions) changed
                between the two versions of the file.  These files
                contain output from the `file-metadata' program with
                the flags `--symlink --permissions', suitable for
                comparison to similar output, and for use as options
                and option arguments to `set-file-metadata'.

                These files are also included if a regular file has
                replaced a symbolic link or vice versa.

                
        new_name/=dir-meta-orig
        new_name/=dir-meta-mod

                Directory metadata (currently only permissions) changed
                between the two versions of the directory containing
                these files.  These files contain output from the
                `file-metadata' program with the flags `--symlink
                --permissions', suitable for comparison to similar
                output, and for use as options and option arguments to
                `set-file-metadata'.


</pre>
<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong> If a regular file (or symbolic link) replaces a directory, or
vice versa, this is recorded as a file (or link) removed (or added) in
one tree and added (or removed) in the other.
