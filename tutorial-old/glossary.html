<p>archive     - An archive is a repository of one or more projects. An
              archive can be located and accessed anywhere. A user may
              have an archive in his home directory or could keep his 
              archive on a remote machine and access it via sftp. A 
                  project may choose to give public access to its archives
                  via http, WebDAV and ftp. 
</p><p>arch        - To reference an arch tree correctly, several pieces are needed:
stanza        the archive name, the archive location and possibly the 
              category, branch, version and revision. This information is
              often passed from one to another in the unofficial form of an
              arch stanza. An arch stanza will often look like this:
</p><pre>
                 someone@somewhere.com--2003
                 http://arch.somewhere.com/{archives}/2003
                 widget--devo--2.5--patch-96

</pre>
<p>arch
stanza
branch      - A branch is an path of development for a category. Though
              projects must (and some simpler projects do) have at least
              one branch, larger projects will often have two or more
              branches for each category. For example a large project may
              have two branches in a category: <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

mainline
</em>
 and <em>
<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

devo
</em>
. The
              mainline branch would carry development for the stable series
              while the devo branch would keep experimental work.
</p><p>branched    - A simple version in which the base-0 revision is a
version       continuation revision.
</p><p>category    - An archive is broken down into categories. Though subtle 
              differences exist, for many a category is synonymous with the
              project itself. As an example, a developer may work on several
              different projects at the same time. Each project would be
              given a different category. A category in arch is what other
              revision control systems, such as cvs, call a repository.
</p><p>category,   - A fully qualified category is the combination of an archive
fully         name and category name in the format of
qualified     <em>
<a name="index-pt:2"></a>

jdoe@example.com--example/mycategory
</em>

</p><p>changeset   - A changeset is collection of changes that change a software
              package from one revision to another
</p><p>changeset   -  A revision created by 'commit'
revision
</p><p>commit      - After changes are made to a tree, arch needs to be told that 
              changes have occured and need to be recorded. This process,
              in slang terms, is called <em>
<a name="index-pt:3"></a>

commiting changes to a branch
</em>
 
</p><p>import      - A revision created by the 'import' command.
revision 
</p><p>log         - A log is a detailed accounting of what changes have taken place
              between revisions in a software project. 
</p><p>pristine    - A pristine tree is an copy of a project tree that has already 
copy          been stored in the project archive to a copy of already
              stored within a project repository
</p><p>ordinary    - A version in which all but the base-0 revision are changeset
version       revision
</p><p>package     - A fully-qualified and unqualified names of categories, branches,
name          version and revisions
</p><p>name
project     - A project has two meanings. In the more general form, a project
              is a gathering of developers and resources that have comitted to
              solving some sort of problem. In a stricter sense, especially
              within the realm of arch, a project refers to the collection of
              software that has been designed by the team that has gathered
              together to to solve a problem.
</p><p>revision    - A revision is generally a set of changes within a branch. As
              such, a revision is a product of the comitting process. 
              Each time a developer commits a change to a tree a revision is              
              created.
</p><p>revision,   - SEE: changeset revision
changeset
</p><p>revision,   - SEE: import revision
import
</p><p>sealed      - A version in which a 'version-0' revision exists
version
</p><p>stanza,    -  See arch stanza
arch
</p><p>version    -  Each branch in tla has one or more versions. The
              version is used to denote the major versions of the software.
              As an example, a hypothetical widget project may have both a
              <code>2</code>
.4 and a <code>2</code>
.4 series that are developed side by side.

<p>Branch/Category/Version/Revision examples
</p><p>For this example imagine that there is a <em>
<a name="index-pt:4"></a>

widget
</em>
 project that has
even/odd releases. For example, <code>1</code>
.2, <code>2</code>
.4 and <code>3</code>
.6 would all contain
stable releases of software. Versions such as <code>1</code>
.3, <code>2</code>
.1 and <code>2</code>
.5 would
be a development series of the software. We could map our categories,
branches, versions and revisions as such:
</p><p>widget--mainline--2.4--patch-12  - This is widget <code>2</code>
.4 with <code>12</code>
 patches.
                                   This tree is intended for people that
                                   wish to track official releases.
widget--mainline--2.5--patch-5   - This is widget-2.4 with <code>5</code>
 patches applied.
                                   This tree is intended for those that wish
                                             to track official releases of <code>2</code>
.5
widget--devo--2.4--patch-14      - This is the development tree of widget.
                                   <code>14</code>
 patches has been applied. This archive
                                   is intended for devolopers that work on
                                   the stable version of widget.
widget--devo--2.5--patch-39      - This is the development tree of the <code>2</code>
.5 
                                   development series of widget. This tree
                                   is intended for developers (and truly
                                   brave users) that wish to be on the
                                   cutting edge of widget.

<h3 align=center>Arch naming conventions</h3>










<p>Given a name of the form: <code>cat--branch--version--revision</code>

</p><pre>
        cat             is a &quot;category name&quot;
        branch          is a &quot;branch label&quot;
        version         is a &quot;version id&quot;
        revision        is a &quot;patch level&quot;

</pre>
<pre>
        cat                             is the name of a &quot;category&quot;
        cat--branch                     is the name of a &quot;branch&quot;
        cat--branch--version            is the name of a &quot;version&quot;
        cat--branch--version--rev       is the name of a &quot;revision&quot;

</pre>
<p>If <code>arch</code>
 is an archive, name, then:
</p><pre>
        arch/cat                        is the &quot;fully qualified&quot; name
                                        of a category

</pre>
<pre>
        arch/cat--branch                is the &quot;fully qualified&quot; name
                                        of a branch

</pre>
<pre>
        and so forth.
