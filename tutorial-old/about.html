<p>Thanks to some generous and quite active volunteer contributions,
plus an apparent trend that the number of people who &quot;grok&quot; arch
is on the rise,  plus the amount of time it takes me to write good
documentation, this manual has entered an experimental phase.
</p><p>What's the experiment?  I've handed off the primary maintenance
responsibilities for the manual, and as much as possible, I'm taking a
hands-off approach to the parts of which may be freely changed.
</p><p>My hypothesis -- or my hope, at least -- is that the arch user
community has grown and matured to the point where they can themselves
work out &quot;what documentation is needed&quot; far better than I can guess
at the answer to that question.
</p><p>As with any experiment, the outcome may be positive, negative, or
inconclusive.   Let's hope for the best.
</p><p><strong><u>Sincerely,</u></strong> <em>Thomas Lord</em>
