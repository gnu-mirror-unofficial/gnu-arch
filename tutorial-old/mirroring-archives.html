<p>A <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

mirror
</em>
 is an archive whose contents are copied from another
archive.   You can not commit to a mirror in the ordinary way, you can
only update its copy of its source.
</p><p>There are two primary uses for mirror archives:  one is to make a
local copy of a remote mirror (so that its contents can be accessed
without going over a network);   the other is to make a remote copy of
a local archive (so that others can access that copy).

<h3 align=center>Mirroring a Remote Archive Locally</h3>










<p>Let's suppose that, in order to have the fastest possible access to
it, or to be able to use it while disconnected, you want to mirror a
remote archive locally rather than accessing it over network.
</p><p>Supposing that you wanted to do this with <code>lord@emf.net--2003b</code>
, there
are three steps (suppose $remote_location is something like 
http://my.site.com//archives/lord@emf.net--2003b).
</p><p>First, register the remote archive under a pseudonum, formed by
appending <code>-SOURCE</code>
 to its name:
</p><pre>
        % tla register-archive lord@emf.net--2003b-SOURCE $remote_location

</pre>
<p>Second, create your local mirror:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --mirror-from lord@emf.net--2003b-SOURCE $local_location

</pre>
<p>That command will, as a side effect, register <code>lord@emf.net--2003b</code>
 as
the name of your local mirror.
</p><p>Finally, copy data from the remote archive:
</p><pre>
        % tla archive-mirror lord@emf.net--2003b

</pre>
<p>Whenever the remote archive has been added to, you can incrementally
update your mirror by repeating the <code>tla archive-mirror</code>
 step.
</p><p>If you don't want to mirror the entire archive, you can optionally
limit the mirror to specific categories, branches, or versions. See
tla archive-mirror -H for more.
</p>

<h3 align=center>Mirroring a Local Archive Remotely</h3>










<p>Let's suppose that you have a local archive <code>mine@somewhere.com</code>
, and
you'd like to &quot;publish&quot; a mirror of that archive on the Internet
so that other people can read from it.
</p><p>Assuming that you already have <code>mine@somewhere.com</code>
 registered, you
can create the remote mirror with:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --mirror mine@somewhere.com $remote_location

</pre>
<p>Arch will write directly to $remote_location, so it must be a writeable
transport such as sftp, and not something such as standard http.
</p><p>You can initialize or incrementally update the contents of the remote
mirror with:
</p><pre>
        % tla archive-mirror mine@somewhere.com

</pre>
<p>One common situation for many people is that they are able to 
install static files as part of a web site, but they can't provide
WebDAV access to that web site.   Even under those conditions you can
still publish an arch archive, though there are two subtleties.
</p><p>First, when running make-archive, you need to provide an extra flag:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --listing --mirror mine@somewhere.com \
                        $remote_location

</pre>
<p>The <code>--listing</code>
 flag causes arch to keep <code>.listing</code>
 files up-to-date
in the mirror, and that, in turn, allows people to read from the
archive using arch over vanilla HTTP (sans WebDAV support).
</p><p>Second, it _is_ possible for the <code>.listing</code>
 files to fall out of date
(for example, if you kill an <code>archive-mirror</code>
 command at just the
right time_.   If you know or suspect that has occurred, you can repair
the archive in question by running archive-fixup as in this example:
</p><pre>
        % tla archive-fixup mine@somewhere.com-MIRROR

</pre>

<h3 align=center>Making a Remote Repository</h3>










<p>Although mirroring is a common use of remote repositories, it is
possible to create remote repositories which are not mirrors, and then
to commit to those directly.   
</p><p>One can create a remote repository with a command such as:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive $archive_name $remote_location

</pre>
<p>or, to create a remote repository with .listing files:
</p><pre>
        % tla make-archive --listing $archive_name $remote_location

</pre>












<a name="Mixing_Access_Modes"></a>



<h3 align=center>Mixing Access Modes</h3>










<p>There is nothing to prevent you from making a single archive available
via multiple access methods.   For example, you can register an FTP
accessible archive using a local-filesystem location on the machine
that contains the FTP directory, but ask other users to register it
with an <code>ftp:</code>
 URL.
