<p>As projects grow larger and more complicated, it is often useful
to be able to give a symbolic name to particular revisions within an
arch version.
</p><p>For example, let's suppose that the <code>hello-world</code>
 project has many
revisions:
</p><pre>

        mainline
        --------
        base-0
        patch-1
        patch-2
        ....
        patch-23



</pre>
<p>It may be that, as development proceeds, occasional &quot;snapshot&quot;
releases are made from the <code>mainline</code>
.  Not every revision becomes a
snapshot, but some do.
</p><p>It would be convenient to provide a label of which revisions became
snapshots:
</p><pre>

        mainline
        --------
        base-0
        patch-1         snapshot 0
        patch-2
        ....
        patch-12        snapshot 2
        ....
        patch-23        snapshot 3



</pre>
<p>The <code>tag</code>
 command, introduced earlier, can be used for this purpose
(see <a href="elementary-branches.html#Making_a_Branch_from_a_Remote_Project_in_a_Local_Archive">Making a Branch from a Remote Project in a Local Archive</a>).
</p><p>When we first encountered <code>tag</code>
, it was used just to create the
<code>base-0</code>
 revision of an elementary branch.   It can also be used to
create a branch <em>all</em> of whose revisions are tags.
</p><p>Let's suppose that we'll be creating a branch called
<code>hello-world--snapshots--0.1</code>
.  Diagramatically, we'll have:
</p><pre>

        mainline                        snapshots
        --------                        ---------
        base-0                --------> base-0 (tag)
        patch-1 -------------'  ------> patch-1 (tag)
        patch-2                '
        ....                  '
        patch-12 ------------'
        ....
        patch-23


</pre>
<p>To create the <code>snapshot</code>
 tag for <code>patch-23</code>
:
</p><pre>

        % tla tag hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-23 \
                    hello-world--snapshots--0.1


</pre>
<p>after which we'll have:
</p><pre>

        mainline                        snapshots
        --------                        ---------
        base-0                --------> base-0 (tag)
        patch-1 -------------'  ------> patch-1 (tag)
        patch-2                ' -----> patch-2 (tag)
        ....                  ' '
        patch-12 ------------' '
        ....                  '
        patch-23 ------------'


</pre>
<p>In effect, the <code>snapshots</code>
 branch is a kind of &quot;symbolic name&quot; with
history.   We can get the latest revision named by that symbol with:
</p><pre>
        % tla get hello-world--snapshots--0.1

</pre>
<p>and earlier revisions by naming specific revisions, e.g.:
</p><pre>
        % tla get hello-world--snapshots--0.1--patch-1

</pre>
<p><strong><u>Usage Caution:</u></strong> As a rule of thumb, your branches should be either
<code>commit</code>
 based branches (all revisions after <code>base-0</code>
 are created by
<code>commit</code>
) or tag-based branches (all revisions are created by <code>tag</code>
).
Commands such as <code>replay</code>
, <code>update</code>
, and <code>star-merge</code>
 are based on the
presumption that you stick to that rule.  While it can be tempting, in
obscure circumstances, to mix <code>commit</code>
 and <code>tag</code>
 on a single branch --
it isn't generally recommended.
