<p>This chapter will teach you one technique for speeding up access to an
<code>arch</code>
 archive.
</p><p>Consider an <code>arch</code>
 version that contains many revisions:
</p><pre>

        mainline
        --------
        base-0
        patch-1
        ....
        patch-23
        patch-24
        patch-25
        ...
        patch-42



</pre>
<p>Suppose that a user (with no local pristine cache) wants to <code>get</code>
 the
<code>patch-42</code>
 revision.   <code>get</code>
 proceeds by first getting and unpacking
the <code>base-0</code>
 revision, then getting each <code>patch-&lt;N></code>
 changeset, in
order, and applying those to the tree.
</p><p>If the list of changesets that need to be applied is long, or the sum
of their sizes large in comparison to the tree side, then this
implementation of <code>get</code>
 is needlessly inefficient.
</p><p>One way to speed up <code>get</code>
 is by <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

archive caching revisions
</em>
 -- storing
&quot;pre-built&quot; copies of some revisions with the archive.
</p><p>For example, the command:
</p><pre>

        % tla cacherev -A lord@emf.net--2003-example \
                hello-world--mainline--0.1--patch-40



</pre>
<p>will build the <code>patch-40</code>
 revision, package it up as a tar bundle, and
store a copy of that tar bundle in the <code>patch-40</code>
 directory of the
archive.
</p><p>Subsequently, a <code>get</code>
 of <code>patch-42</code>
 will work by first fetching the
cached copy of the <code>patch-40</code>
 revision, then getting and applying the
changesets for <code>patch-41</code>
 and <code>patch-42</code>
:  a savings of <code>40</code>
 changesets.
</p><p><strong><u>Usage Note:</u></strong>  At this time, it's left up to you to decide which
revisions to cache and which not.   You might decide, for example, to
automatically cache certain revisions from a <code>cron</code>
 job or to simply
cache revisions by-hand whenever you notice that <code>get</code>
 is too slow.
In the future, we hope to add better support for automatically caching
revisions.
