<p><a name="index-pt:0"></a>

</p><p>For many purposes, it is useful to have a library containing pristine
trees of a large number of revisions -- for example, all of the
revisions in a particular version.  To be practical, though, such a
library must be represented in a space-efficient way.
</p><p>Unix hard-links provide a natural way to store such a library.  Each
successive revision in a series is a copy of the previous, but with
unmodified files shared via hard-links.
</p><p><code>arch</code>
 provides commands to help you build, maintain, and browse such
a library.
</p><p>As a pleasant side effect, many <code>arch</code>
 commands are speeded up if the
revisions they need to operate are present in your revision library.
You can read more about this in the next chapter.
</p>
<a name="Your_Revision_Library_Location"></a>



<h3 align=center>Your Revision Library Location</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:1"></a>

</p><p>To begin a new revision library, first create a new directory (<code>DIR</code>
)
and then register its location:
</p><pre>
        % tla my-revision-library DIR

</pre>
<p>You can check the location of your library with:
</p><pre>
        % tla my-revision-library

</pre>
<p>or unregister it with:
</p><pre>
        % tla my-revision-library -d

</pre>












<a name="Revision_Library_Format"></a>



<h3 align=center>Revision Library Format</h3>










<p>A revision library has subdirectories of the form:
</p><pre>
        ARCHIVE-NAME/CATEGORY/BRANCH/VERSION/REVISION/

</pre>
<p>Each <code>REVISION</code>
 directory contains the complete source of a particular
revision, along with some supplemantary subdirectories and files:
</p><pre>

        REVISION/,,patch-set/

                The patch set that creates this revision from
                its ancestor (unless the revision is a full-source
                base revision).


</pre>
<p>Although the permissions on files in the revision library are
determined as determined by patch sets, <strong>you must never modify files
int the revision library</strong>.  Doing so will cause odd errors and
failures in various <code>arch</code>
 commands.
</p>











<a name="Adding_a_Revision_to_the_Library"></a>



<h3 align=center>Adding a Revision to the Library</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:2"></a>

</p><p>You can add a selected revision to your revision library with:
</p><pre>
        % tla library-add REVISION

</pre>
<p>That will add not only <code>REVISION</code>
 to the library, but all directly
preceeding revisions (recursively) which are either from the same
archive, or from other archives which are also in the same library.
(&quot;Directly preceeding&quot; in this case means the previous patch level,
for ordinary revisions, or the tagged revision (for revisions which
are tags).)
</p>











<a name="Finding_a_Revision_in_the_Library"></a>



<h3 align=center>Finding a Revision in the Library</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:3"></a>

</p><p>You can find a particular revision in the library with <code>library-find</code>
:
</p><pre>
        % tla library-find REVISION
        PATH-TO-REVSION

</pre>
<p>The output is an absolute path name to the library directory containing
the revision.  (Once again, you must not modify files in that
directory.)
</p>











<a name="Removing_a_Revision_from_the_Library"></a>



<h3 align=center>Removing a Revision from the Library</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:4"></a>

</p><p>To remove a particular revision from the library, use:
</p><pre>
        % tla library-remove REVISION

</pre>
<p>Be aware of the following limitation in the current release:  suppose
that you add three successive revisions, <code>A</code>
, <code>B</code>
, and <code>C</code>
.  Then you
remove <code>B</code>
, then re-add <code>B</code>
.  Now there is a chance that the file
sharing between <code>B</code>
 and <code>C</code>
 will be less than optimal, causing your
library to be larger than it needs to be.  (You can fix this by then
removing and re-adding <code>C</code>
.)
</p>











<a name="Listing_Library_Contents"></a>



<h3 align=center>Listing Library Contents</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:5"></a>

<a name="index-pt:6"></a>

<a name="index-pt:7"></a>

<a name="index-pt:8"></a>

<a name="index-pt:9"></a>

</p><p>The command <code>library-archives</code>
 lists all archives with records in the library:
</p><pre>
        % tla library-archives
        ARCHIVE-NAME
        ARCHIVE-NAME
        ...

</pre>
<p>Similarly, you can list categories, branches, versions, or revisions:
</p><pre>
        % tla library-categories [ARCHIVE]
        % tla library-branches [ARCHIVE/CATEGORY]
        % tla library-versions [ARCHIVE/BRANCH]
        % tla library-revisions [ARCHIVE/VERSION]

</pre>












<a name="Individual_Files_in_the_Revision_Library"></a>



<h3 align=center>Individual Files in the Revision Library</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:10"></a>

<a name="index-pt:11"></a>

</p><p>You can locate an individual file in a revision library with:
</p><pre>
        % tla library-file FILE [REVISION]
        PATH

</pre>
<p>or obtain its contents with:
</p><pre>
        % tla cat-library-file FILE [REVISION]
        ...file contents...

</pre>
<p>Both commands accept the options <code>--id</code>
 and <code>--this</code>
.  With <code>--id</code>
,
the argument <code>FILE</code>
 is interpreted as an inventory id, and the file
with that id is found.
</p><p>With <code>--this</code>
, <code>FILE</code>
 is interpreted as a file relative to the current
directory, which should be part of a project tree.  The file's
inventory id is computed and the corresponding file found in
<code>REVISION</code>
.
</p>











<a name="Determining_Patch_Set_Prerequisits"></a>



<h3 align=center>Determining Patch Set Prerequisits</h3>










<p><a name="index-pt:12"></a>

</p><pre>
          % tla touched-files-prereqs REVISION

</pre>
<p>That command looks at the patch set for <code>REVISION</code>
 and at all
preceding patch sets in the same version (it searches your library
rather than your repository for this purpose).  It reports the list of
patches that touch overlapping sets of files and directories -- in
other words, it tells you what patches can be applied independently of
others.  The command has an option to exclude from consideration file
names matching a certain pattern (e.g. <em>
<a name="index-pt:13"></a>

=README
</em>
 or <em>
<a name="index-pt:14"></a>

ChangeLog
</em>
).  It
has an option to exclude from the output list patches which have
already been applied to a given project tree.  It has an option to
report the specific files which are overlapped.
