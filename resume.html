Summary:

Excellent programmer, founder of successful free software projects
(GNU Arch, GNU Guile), strong C programmer, configuration/build tools
experience, years of experience with Linux and Unix generally.
Notorious curmudgeon.  Good knowledge of applied CS and practical
software engineering.  Revision control system expert.  A variety of
ongoing projects in early stages (a wiki engine, a globally
distributed file manager, high-level language interpreters, an
advanced Unicode string library, a few more).  "Merit" winner of an
Open Source Award (www.opensource.org), Q2 2004.  Long time supporter
and periodic project maintainer for the Free Software Foundation GNU
project (www.gnu.org).


Objective:

A practical means to support my family and ongoing work, consistent
with the values associated with the Free Software Movement.
Attractive positions might range from R&amp;D positions where my
role is to continue one or more of my projects (or start or join
a new one) to basic day jobs (order fulfillment, fetching coffee,
sweeping floors, whatever -- I'm limited only by comparatively
moderate wage requirements, the amount of time left over for family
and hacking pursuits, and some physiological constraints on the kinds
of physical labor I can sustain).   Between those two extremes are
many options of which I must reject only those which would ask me
to develop non-free software.


Experience (highlights):

01/2001-present
The GNU Arch revision control system
Founder and maintainer
I designed and implemented the GNU Arch revision control
system and coordinated volunteer contributors for the 
first several years of its development.  (www.seyza.com
and www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch).  The first version
was written as shell scripts;  the current version is
in C.   Arch has been a successful project, culminating
ultimately in its "takeover" by Canonical corp. who have
adopted it as a cornerstone of their business.  This 
work included developing a configuration system to use
instead of GNU autoconf and further development of
"libhackerlab" -- my suite of utilities for C programs.

A considerable portion of this work was supported by
monetary gifts from happy users and interested hackers.


1998-2000
UUNET Research
Consultant
Working remotely and independently I implemented a suite
of tools for "pointer use debugging" of C programs: a
drop-in replacement for standard `malloc' with features
to help detect stray writes and reads.   This work included
modifications to GCC which provided user-definable read
and write barriers across all platforms.


9/1993-12/1995
Cygnus Support
Member of the technical staff
I started the GNU Guile project (a Scheme-based extension
language).  As part of this work I created a mutual 
embedding of Scheme in Tcl and vice versa and developed
a Scheme interface to the Tk toolkit.


9/1991-8/1993
Free Software Foundation
Hacker
I fixed bugs in GNU sed, began writing a fast regular expression
engine (completed several years later), and added features to GNU
Oleo, a simple spreadsheet program.


8/1987-8/1989
Information Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University
At the Andrew project, I developed an autoconf-like set
of tools for configuration and build management.


Code samples:
The latest releases of GNU Arch 1.x and GNU Arch 2.0 are
good sources for code samples.  Code within these distributions
represents a spectrum of practical software engineering 
practices varying according to deadlines and resources available.
Core parts of "libhackerlab", included in both, show careful
and steady co-development of code, tests, and documentation.
"awiki" (in 2.0) shows a useful "working prototype" used to
explore the design space of wiki syntax generators.  "tla" (in 1.x)
falls in the middle between those extremes.

Education:
Studied at Johns Hopkins University and Carnegie Mellon
University.   Most of my CS education has been a combination
of self-directed reading and on-the-job mentor-ships -- I hold
only a high-school diploma.
